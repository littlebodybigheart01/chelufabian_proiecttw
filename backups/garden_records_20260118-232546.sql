390261	In The Zone	Britney Spears	118.94	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/28/48/0828765374828_600.jpg	qobuz:15505552|0828765374828	If 2001's Britney was a transitional album, capturing Spears at the point when she wasn't a girl and not yet a woman, its 2003 follow-up, In the Zone, is where she has finally completed that journey and turned into Britney, the Adult Woman. Like her peer Christina Aguilera, Britney equates maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs, but since she's not as dirrty as Xtina, her spin is a little different. Where Christina comes across like a natural-born skank, Britney is the girl next door cutting loose at college, drinking and smoking and dancing and sexing just a little too recklessly, since this is the first time she can indulge herself. And that's what In the Zone is -- Britney indulging herself, desperate to prove that she's an adult. Since she's a pop diva, the record label certainly set some limits -- and, really, given her track record and taste, there was little chance that she would follow Pink's lead and write an album with a punk rocker and then draft Peaches for a cameo -- but she has been freed from her musical parent, Max Martin, who is absent for the first time from a Britney Spears album. She's chosen to play the field and work with a bunch of different collaborators, including Madonna, Moby, the Matrix, Trixster, Roy "Royality" Hamilton, Bloodshy & Avant, and R. Kelly. This laundry list of producers and co-writers reveals a combination of savvy and stupidity, reminiscent of the good ideas and bad judgment a young adult goes through in the throes of adjusting to maturity, but one thing ties it all together: her yearning to prove that she's a mature adult. Since the songs are almost exclusively about sex or dancing, with an empowerment tune and a couple of heartbreak ballads tossed in for good measure, it's a pretty limited definition of adulthood, which would be fine if Spears didn't treat it all so seriously, as if maturity were only about sex and dancing. Since she's so determined to be a woman, not a girl, she has completely shed the sugarcoated big hooks and sappy love songs that drove her stardom, concentrating on music that glides by on mellow grooves or hits hard with its hip-hop beats. It's all club-ready, but despite some hints of neo-electro and the Neptunes, it doesn't quite sound modern -- it sounds like cuts from 1993 or Madonna's Bedtime Stories and Ray of Light. Madonna, of course, duets on the album's first single, "Me Against the Music," whose title practically begs to be mocked. Unfortunately, any snarky jokes directed at the song are warranted, since it's the worst single either Britney or Madonna had yet released, a songless mess of staccato beats whose chorus weirdly recalls Oasis' "D'You Know What I Mean." Neither singer has much range, yet they usually exploit their weakness well; here, they succumb to their limitations to the point that their thin voices are indistinguishable apart from Madonna singing "Hey Britney" ad nauseam. This is not the only time on In the Zone that the music is hampered by Britney's limited vocal abilities. She may be older now, but she still sounds like a little girl, which undercuts both the glistening, sensual mid-tempo grooves that dominate the album and the big, booming up-tempo cuts that offer a change of pace. Production-wise, these tracks are not only accomplished but much more varied than any of her previous albums -- in particular, Moby's "Early Mornin'" has a sleek feel, Mark Taylor's "Breathe on Me" is alluring, and the Bloodshy & Avant productions "Showdown" and "Toxic" are irresistible ear candy -- but Britney's voice just isn't sexy enough to sell these songs; she often sounds like a girl dressing up in her big sister's clothes, whether she's murmuring seductive or delving into rap and ragga. All of this undercuts not just the songs, but the theme of the album, since it seems that she's still not yet a woman, no matter how much she protests that she is. While there are surely some good moments here and while this is surely her most ambitious, adventurous album to date, it's not a particularly successful one, since she treats her freedom as a burden, not a blessing. After all, if an album is going to be about sex, dancing, and freedom, it should at the very least sound joyous and fun. In the Zone deliberately avoids fun, which is why it's less likeable than Britney's previous albums, even if it is musically more accomplished.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	31	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:50:37.10069	1

After all, she gives away the plot with the ingenious title of her second album, Oops!...I Did It Again, essentially admitting that the record is more of the same. It has the same combination of sweetly sentimental ballads and endearingly gaudy dance-pop that made One More Time. Fortunately, she and her production team not only have a stronger overall set of songs this time, but they also occasionally get carried away with the same bewildering magpie aesthetic that made the first album's "Sodapop" -- a combination of bubblegum, urban soul, and raga -- a gonzo teen pop classic. It doesn't happen all that often -- the clenched-funk revision of the Stones' deathless "Satisfaction" is the most obvious example -- but it helps give the album character apart from the well-crafted dance-pop and ballads that serve as its heart. In the end, it's what makes this an entertaining, satisfying listen.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	32	CD	2026-01-18 21:50:37.100698	2
652121	Femme Fatale (Deluxe Version)	Britney Spears	398.21	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/42/88/0884977898842_600.jpg	qobuz:3437466|0884977898842	The aftermath of Britney Spears’ 2007 freak-out and Blackout wound up with her ceding control of her personal and professional life to her father and producers, respectively, leaving her as no more than a figurehead of an enterprise. Of course, Brit Brit had essentially been the face of a carefully calibrated pop machine for years, but every element of that contraption hinged on her persona, the songs and the sound fitting her evolution. Starting with Blackout, Britney started to slip into the background on her own records, a progression that continued unabated on Circus and finds some kind of culmination on 2011’s Femme Fatale. Essentially a cleaner, classier remake of the gaudily dark Blackout, Femme Fatale is a producer’s paradise, each cut decked out with stretched vocals, glassy keyboards, and insistent beats, all coming together in hyperactive arrangements that shift every five seconds. Sonically, it has everything except hooks, either in the rhythm or the melody; it’s all surface style, driven by sound and given shape by hypersexual lyrics Britney sings listlessly. Her name and face are on the cover but she is not at the album’s center; she is nowhere to be found amidst the clamor created by Dr. Luke, will.i.am, Bloodshy, Shellback, and Max Martin; she’s a black hole of charisma sucking everything in. Britney dutifully steps through the paces, singing enough of the words so they can be tweaked in the computer, never quite investing anything with emotion, never getting in the way of the producers, who deliver a showcase somewhat less captivating than Blackout. Surely, there are moments, sometimes stretched over a full song, that are compelling, but even these can’t erase the feeling that Britney no longer has a real, tangible personality. She’s now a reliable brand selling high-class productions designed to last not one minute longer than their season of release.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	10	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:50:37.100698	1

Sin City's influence can be heard within the splashiness of the arrangements of certain portions of Glory, the 2016 album designed to be Britney's return to the Top 40. To that end, Glory downplays the show biz glitz of Vegas in favor of modern dance-pop, one with EDM undercurrents and hip-hop overtones. Sometimes echoes of other stars can be heard -- Justin Bieber's Purpose appears to a primary text -- but despite this contemporary gloss, the album usually relies on sounds of Spears' past, trading heavily on the cloistered dance of Blackout and the shimmering neon of Femme Fatale. Glory is much lighter than either album, a reflection of Britney's maturation -- the softer nocturnal numbers make a play for Ellie Goulding territory, but they could slide onto adult contemporary -- and her willingness to be goofy. Some of the highlights are the silliest songs: the swinging "Clumsy," the overheated flamenco chorus of "Do You Wanna Come Over?," and "Private Show" and "Slumber Party," a pair of heavy-breathing come-ons that never manage to seem sexy despite the flood of innuendo. Such moments accentuate Britney's playfulness, an aspect of her persona that's been in hibernation for nearly a decade, and it's a welcome return, as is Glory as a whole: it feels as fun and frivolous as her earliest music while retaining the freshness of her best mature work.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	14	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:50:37.1007	1
868326	Oops!... I Did It Again 	Britney Spears	43.21	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/ea/jc/urxrrijq8jcea_600.jpg	qobuz:328069826|urxrrijq8jcea	Given the phenomenal success of Britney Spears' debut, ...Baby One More Time, it should come as no surprise that its sequel offers more of the same. After all, she gives away the plot with the ingenious title of her second album, Oops!...I Did It Again, essentially admitting that the record is more of the same. It has the same combination of sweetly sentimental ballads and endearingly gaudy dance-pop that made One More Time. Fortunately, she and her production team not only have a stronger overall set of songs this time, but they also occasionally get carried away with the same bewildering magpie aesthetic that made the first album's "Sodapop" -- a combination of bubblegum, urban soul, and raga -- a gonzo teen pop classic. It doesn't happen all that often -- the clenched-funk revision of the Stones' deathless "Satisfaction" is the most obvious example -- but it helps give the album character apart from the well-crafted dance-pop and ballads that serve as its heart. In the end, it's what makes this an entertaining, satisfying listen.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	17	CD	2026-01-18 21:50:37.100701	2

473104	Greatest Hits: My Prerogative	Britney Spears	237.57	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/25/94/0828766529425_600.jpg	qobuz:4840212|0828766529425	Greatest Hits: My Prerogative appeared at the tail end of a year where Britney Spears was married twice, canceled a tour, injured her knee, lost the movie role of Daisy Duke to rival teen pop diva Jessica Simpson, was a punch line in Fahrenheit 9/11, and had countless paparazzi shots of her drinking and making out in public. It was enough high-profile shenanigans for a career, and it was par for the course for Britney, who hadn't been out of the pop culture headlines since she released her debut album, ...Baby One More Time, in January 1999. In the nearly six years separating that debut album and the release of Greatest Hits in November 2004, Britney was omnipresent, representing both the entire teen pop phenomenon of the turn of the millennium, plus the teasing, Maxim-fueled sexuality of the time; it's not for nothing that Tom Wolfe name drops Britney Spears, not archrival Christina Aguilera, in his 2004 novel I Am Charlotte Simmons -- Britney alone captured the era, which in turn is captured on this 17-track hits collection. If Bob Dylan had a hard time being a voice of a generation (which he does acknowledge in his autobiography, Chronicles), imagine the weight put upon this simple Louisiana girl who just wanted to be famous and became a cultural icon instead! During those six years, she kept turning out product, selling herself with increasingly racy photographs, all the while being used as an example of everything that's wrong with pop culture, or even worse, as the subject of cultural theses explaining pop culture. No wonder that after six years of mind-boggling fame she wanted to abandon her career for motherhood -- it's exhausting being in the limelight, even for a shameless pop star! So, Greatest Hits arrived at a perfect time -- just as her star was fading, just as the teen pop era grew to a close, and just as she readied herself for retirement. As a time capsule, Greatest Hits does its job well. It has all of her hits outside of "From the Bottom of My Broken Heart," a largely forgotten ballad from her debut released just before her second album, Oops!...I Did It Again, and it contains two very good previously unreleased tunes, including the In the Zone outtake "I've Just Begun (Having My Fun)," an infectious spin on No Doubt's "Hella Good" that betters most of the songs that were featured on the album (it also has a useless remake of Bobby Brown's "My Prerogative," which seems to exist solely for its video). Clearly, this is the album not just for the casual fan, but for any fan of Spears, because like most teen pop singers, her albums are notoriously spotty affairs, memorable largely for the singles themselves. What is surprising is that those singles -- all presented here in their hit forms, which means this has the "Stop Remix" of "(You Drive Me) Crazy," not the album version -- are somewhat less than the sum of their parts when collected together. The similarities in Max Martin's clanking, insistent writing and production become blindingly evident, and Britney's thin, squeaky voice wears thin over the course of 17 songs. Also, the song selection and sequencing emphasize keeping the perfect beat over chronology, which not only makes it a little harder to listen to as an album, it puts the focus on the individual songs, which seem neither as hooky or catchy as they did when they were initially on the radio. There are exceptions to the rule, of course -- "...Baby One More Time" still retains its punch, "Oops!...I Did It Again" is so silly it's hard to resist, "(You Drive Me) Crazy" is fluffy dance-pop at its best, and "Toxic" is a delirious, intoxicating rush -- but they're all better as individual moments, even if when taken together, they do illustrate the cacophonous monotony of her music and, yes, her time quite well. So, even if it isn't a great listen as a cohesive album, Greatest Hits does perform the valuable function of offering all of Britney's hits in one place, and it does work as a portrait of the time when Britney Spears was the defining figure of American pop culture. But if you compare it to The Immaculate Collection, which captured the time when Madonna was the defining figure of American pop culture and does work as an album, it's clear that a cultural artifact isn't necessarily the same thing as great music.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	30	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:50:37.100701	1

Even crazier, it reads like a greatest hits album. The strobelight-ready electropop opener "Disease"—laden with low growls and high falsetto notes—recalls the gothic drama of her early hit "Poker Face." The melodramatic balladry of "Blade of Grass" echoes "Shallow." "Zombieboy" blends cheerleader chants, funk bass lines and a power bridge to remind you of the great "Bad Romance." Techno-glowsticky "Abracadabra" borrows from it, too, while also nicking the melody of Siouxsie and the Banshees' "Spellbound." Sweaty club banger "Garden of Eden" mimics the slinky power of 2011's "Bloody Mary," complete with a catchy chorus ("I'll t-t-take you to the Garden of Eden") that smacks you right in the face. That's maximalist Gaga's talent, of course, and she doesn't hold back on the first nine or so songs, which hit hard. The super-hooky synth-disco number "Vanish Into You" is like a windstorm, and that's a compliment. Credit an assist from producer Andrew Watt, who earned his rock 'n' roll bona fides working with Pearl Jam, the Rolling Stones and Ozzy; this is a dance record that leans hard on rock elements and motifs. Gaga has said "Perfect Celebrity" was originally conceived as a grunge song by way of The Cure's "Never Enough," and while you can still hear it in the guitar line, it's also heavy with her classic bombast of heavy breathing and diva runs. The artist has called it "the most angry song" she's ever written, and the lyrics reflect the trap of her ivory-tower existence: "I've become a notorious being/ Find my clone, she's asleep on the ceiling/ Now, can't get me down/ You love to hate me/ I'm the perfect celebrity." Elsewhere, she nods to Bowie ("Killah," featuring French DJ Gesaffelstein, wraps its arms around the iconic "Fame" riff), Taylor Swift (poppy outlier "How Bad Do U Want Me") and '70s soft rock via "Die With a Smile," her lush, loungey duet with Bruno Mars. But for the most part, the Mayhem pastiche is a mirror. Love her or hate her, we are lucky to live in a time where Lady Gaga can be as weird and experimental as she wants to be. © Shelly Ridenour/Qobuz	27	CD	2026-01-18 21:50:39.663004	2
209417	A Star Is Born Soundtrack	Lady Gaga	279.73	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/9a/7w/od7jgep3n7w9a_600.jpg	qobuz:54162291|od7jgep3n7w9a	There's a narrative to the soundtrack for Bradley Cooper's 2018 remake of A Star Is Born, one that mirrors the one told in the movie. Often, the album features dialogue ripped from the screen -- a full 15 tracks, actually, amounting to seven minutes of this 74-minute album -- which means A Star Is Born almost plays like a Disney record from the '60s or '70s: it's designed to tide listeners over until they get a chance to see the movie again. Of course, A Star Is Born is a musical, so its soundtrack is filled with full-fledged songs, all of which serve the story that the dialogue gooses along. Strip out the distracting dialogue tracks and the plot of A Star Is Born is still evident, as the music moves from the grungy Americana of Cooper's character, through his affecting duets with Lady Gaga, toward her flashy pop, and then culminating with "I'll Never Love Again," the song where the two estranged lovers reunite. Each of these phases is expertly executed. Lukas Nelson assists Cooper in the rangy grunge of "Black Eyes," while Jason Isbell's spare "Maybe It's Time" is an affecting slice of Americana. The second stage, where Gaga is duetting with Cooper, fuses their sensibilities seamlessly, particularly on the aching ballad "Shallow" and loping country-rock of "Music to My Eyes," which was co-written by Nelson and Gaga. Her pop section plays like its own EP, and it's snappy, stylish, and savvy, particularly on the retro-disco of "Why Did You Do That?" and soulful "Heal Me." All the songs make sense narratively and on their own, so they hold together well and would amount to a first-rate soundtrack, if it weren't for those meddling dialogue tracks, which wind up sapping any kind of momentum for the album.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	31	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:50:52.974397	1
966452	The Fame	Lady Gaga	349.09	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/54/34/0060255743454_600.jpg	qobuz:38181958|0060255743454	The times were crying out for a pop star like Lady GaGa -- a self-styled, self-made shooting star, one who mocked the tabloid digital age while still wanting to wallow in it -- and one who's smart enough to pull it all off, too. That self-awareness and satire were absent in the pop of the new millennium, where even the best of the lot operated only on one level, which may be why Lady GaGa turned into such a sensation in 2009: everybody was thirsty for music like this, music for and about their lives, both real and virtual. To a certain extent, the reaction to The Fame may have been a little too enthusiastic, with GaGa turning inescapable sometime in the summer of 2009, when she appeared on countless magazine covers while both Weezer and DAUGHTRY covered “Pokerface,” the rush to attention suggesting that she was the second coming of Madonna, a comparison GaGa cheerfully courts and one that’s accurate if perhaps overextended. Like the marvelous Madge, Lady GaGa ushers the underground into the mainstream -- chiefly, a dose of diluted Peaches delivered via a burbling cauldron of electro-disco -- by taming it just enough so it’s given the form of pop yet remains titillating. Sure, GaGa sings of disco sticks, bluffin’ with her muffin, and rough sex, but her provocation doesn’t derive solely from her words: this is music that sounds thickly sexy with its stainless steel synths and dark disco rhythms. Where GaGa excels, and why she crossed over, is how she doesn’t leave all this as a collection of hooks and rhythms, she shapes them into full-blown pop songs, taking the time to let the album breathe with chillout ballads and percolating new wave, like the title track that echoes Gwen Stefani in dance diva mode. But where Gwen simply celebrates celeb consumer culture, GaGa bites, her litany of runway models, pornographic girls, and body plastic delivered with an undercurrent of disdain, even as she loves all the glitz. This dichotomy propels much of The Fame, particularly on the clever “Paparazzi,” where she casts herself as the photographic parasite chasing after her crush, but none of this meta text would work if the songs didn’t click, functioning simultaneously as glorious pop trash and a wicked parody of it.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	10	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:50:52.974402	1

It was inevitable that Born This Way would be an escalation of The Fame, it was inevitable that Gaga would go where others feared to tread, it was inevitable that it would be bigger than any other record thrown down in 2011, both in its scale and success. This drumbeat, pulsating as insistently as Eurodisco, is so persistent that there is an inevitable feeling of anticlimax upon hearing Born This Way for the first time and realizing that Lady Gaga has channeled her grand ambitions into her message, and not her music. Gaga has taken it upon herself to filter out whatever personal details remain in her songs so she can write anthems for her Little Monsters, that ragtag group of queers, misfits, outcasts, and rough kids who she calls her own. Gaga is hardly insincere -- this isn’t an act, she’s been instrumental as a gay rights activist -- but her conquistador stance ironically reduces Born This Way to a collection of songs about fashion, freaks, and religion, with the occasional respite arriving via German unicorns. Unfortunately, this doesn’t play quite as weird as it reads. Whatever performance art shock Gaga had on The Fame/The Fame Monster has turned into pure theater. Her drama club ambition to marry rock & roll rebellion with her disco beats turns Born This Way into Like a Prayer by way of Bat Out of Hell. Gaga has chosen not to dig under the skin. She’s quite content to state her themes then let them be, using them as the connecting thread on an ‘80s pastiche set to a relentless Eurotrash throb. Echoes of Whitney Houston, Pat Benatar, and Bruce Springsteen -- whose longtime running partner Clarence Clemons blows sax on two songs --- can be heard throughout, but it is naturally Madonna who is the cornerstone, giving Gaga the “Express Yourself” melody -- which is reworked on no less than three songs on the Deluxe Edition (and really, with an album this over the top, why skimp with the standard edition?) -- and a pop precedent for Catholic guilt. Lady Gaga doesn’t so much rip off Madonna as knowingly recontextualize the Material Girl for a post-modern collage, the sly similarities offering tangible reminders that Gaga is the heir to the diva throne. And Born This Way does solidify her standing as something of a pop visionary, although Gaga is a little bit too eager to embrace her role as messiah, letting her skills as a songwriter slide ever so slightly. Gaga’s true gift is her considerable dexterity at delivering the basics. Unlike so many of her peers, she does not cut and paste her tracks digitally, she constructs from the chords up, then accessorizes at will. She doesn’t abandon this sensibility on Born This Way, but she does take it for granted, never pushing her compositions or productions into unpredictable territory. She serves up the expected, which can be quite satisfying: “Marry the Night” glistens with a neon pulse, “Born This Way” has a giddiness to its self-importance, “Judas” turns “Alejandro” into towering gothic disco, she achieves her metal-disco fusion on “Bad Kids,” and she even shows vulnerability on “Yoü and I.” All well and good, and all very entertaining, but this is an album that’s meant to be more: it’s intended to be a soundtrack to a way of life, but it winds up playing as a collection of songs.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	15	CD	2026-01-18 21:50:52.974403	2

"I live on Chromatica, that is where I live. I went into my frame - I found Earth, I deleted it. Earth is cancelled", she said during the promotion for this sixth album, released less than two years after the global success of the soundtrack for A Star Is Born. Chromatica's sci-fi concept naturally steered the singer towards electronic music, tinged with concise and melodic pop. She not only surrounded herself with experienced producers (BloodPop, Burns, Madeon, Axwell...), but also with "extra-terrestrial" guest stars: Ariana Grande (Rain on Me), the K-pop band Blackpink (Sour Candy), and - with a large generational gap - Elton John (Sine From Above).On this flamboyant pink outfit-filled planet, Lady Gaga displays herself as a warrior fighting her own demons, as well as external threats, especially those that overwhelm her fellow-women (Plastic Doll, Free Woman). Her weapon of choice? The most "stupid" love there is, which she clamours for in a cathartic and liberating way (Stupid Love). As the queen of binary bass drums and boundless joy (Fun Tonight), she also has a calm side, especially in three lyrical and majestic instrumentals (Chromatica I, II and III). As the title suggests, Lady Gaga's planet presents an entire spectrum of colours, just like the singer's resolutely colourful soul. © Nicolas Magenham/Qobuz	20	CD	2026-01-18 21:50:52.974403	2

Tapping into her theatrical side, this companion piece to the Joker: Folie à Deux film (and not the other, actual official soundtrack) blurs the line between the persona (Harleen "Lee" Quinzel, aka Harley Quinn) and the person (Gaga). Take this as the debut album from the character of Harley Quinn, as played by Lady Gaga. Putting on that mask, she's free to step outside of the mainline Gaga album trajectory and get playful. In the role of Lee, an in-character Gaga is allowed to say the quiet parts of her own experiences out loud (more so than she allows herself on her proper albums), and it's wonderfully liberating to hear her express these feelings with a wink and a smile. There are bright and brash show tunes ("That's Entertainment") and American Songbook standards ("Good Morning," "Get Happy"), often spun into sweaty New Orleans jazz send-ups, and it's done with more accessible ease than her Tony Bennett collaborations. On the other end of the spectrum, the quieter, lush arrangements are the real draw. Charlie Chaplin's "Smile" is given space to breathe, a piano-backed standout that's so engrossing it transports listeners to a smoky Parisian lounge, while "World on a String" (her spin on Harold Arlen and Ted Koehler's "I've Got the World on a String") hypnotizes with soulful guitar wizardry and a light gospel touch. Grand showpiece "The Joker" could have been on Joanne, as an edgy, feral blast with a booming vocal performance as intense as the showstopper on "Shallow." Similarly, "Happy Mistake" (one of two Gaga originals) is another powerful showcase of her ever-evolving vocals, which nearly eclipse the dour acoustic guitar and swirling atmospheric production. Top to bottom, this is a coveted no-skips effort, elevated by the fun, liberated approach that helps the listener escape reality and push the limits like the characters in the film.© Neil Z.

261095	Joanne	Lady Gaga	69.94	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/na/p1/qnykz49m0p1na_600.jpg	qobuz:112881043|qnykz49m0p1na	It's difficult not to view Joanne through the prism of Artpop, the 2013 album where Lady Gaga's expanding fame balloon finally popped. Ambitious but muddled, Artpop debuted high but came crashing down to the ground, stalling out after the second single, the R. Kelly duet "Do What U Want." Gaga quickly retreated to the confines of cabaret, cutting a nicely accomplished standards album with Tony Bennett, a move that not only gave her the opportunity to work with a legend, but signaled that she considered Artpop a step too far: The camp of Cheek to Cheek was elegant, not garish, an acknowledgment that she was once again back in control of her joke. It set the stage for Joanne, a clever streamlining of the Lady Gaga persona that functions as the opposite of Artpop. All the excesses are excised while the eccentricities are used as accents on songs that are usually well-rendered pop. A few numbers take a passing glance at country music -- the title "Joanne" winks at Dolly Parton's "Jolene"; in a different arrangement, the ballad "Million Reasons" could be an adult contemporary crossover from Faith Hill or Shania Twain -- but Gaga's feet remain firmly planted in dance-pop even when she brings in Father John Misty, Beck, Florence Welch, and Josh Homme of Queens of the Stone Age for collaborations. Homme co-wrote "Diamond Heart" and "John Wayne," two of the harder disco songs here, while Misty assists on the steady rolling "Sinner's Prayer" -- perhaps the best fusion of country and pop here -- and "Come to Mama," a buoyant throwback to Motown that finds a companion on the Welch duet "Hey Girl," an analog slow jam that floats in the shimmer light. These, plus the riotous "A-Yo" and the masturbation ode "Dancin' in Circles," don't necessarily find comfortable companions in the ballads peppered throughout the album, but executive producer Mark Ronson helps polish Joanne so it flows easily, which is its appeal. © Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	19	CD	2026-01-18 21:50:52.974405	2

The unlikely duo had some fun revisiting the Great American Songbook (Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Billy Strayhorn, Duke Ellington) with a sense of mischief, playfulness and a certain class. Despite his age, Sinatra's favourite singer proved, at the dawn of his 90s, that he was still an unbeatable crooner. But the biggest surprise was from Lady Gaga and her unique, spot-on timbre, which can excel in other material and not just Poker Face... Seven years on, the two stars, 60 years apart, set off on a second adventure that proved as delicious as the first, this time devoted entirely to the repertoire of Cole Porter. Backed up by a gleaming big band with five-star brass and silky strings, the evergreen Night & Day, Love For Sale and I Get a Kick Out of You have all the charm of old luxury cars, the softness of leather club chairs and the smoothness of velvet. There are no surprises, and no formal revolutions, in this pair's mischievous vocal jousting: just the pleasure of an hour of retro vocal jazz done just right, a passport out of the tumult of the present day. Salutary. © Marc Zisman/Qobuz	31	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:50:52.974406	1
111932	BORN THIS WAY THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY	Lady Gaga	79.36	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/ka/zp/gljjxg3v8zpka_600.jpg	qobuz:124710667|gljjxg3v8zpka	Not long into the ceaseless promotional parade for Born This Way, Lady Gaga’s second full-length record and easily the most anticipated record of the 2010s, a certain sense of inevitability crept into play. It was inevitable that Born This Way would be an escalation of The Fame, it was inevitable that Gaga would go where others feared to tread, it was inevitable that it would be bigger than any other record thrown down in 2011, both in its scale and success. This drumbeat, pulsating as insistently as Eurodisco, is so persistent that there is an inevitable feeling of anticlimax upon hearing Born This Way for the first time and realizing that Lady Gaga has channeled her grand ambitions into her message, and not her music. Gaga has taken it upon herself to filter out whatever personal details remain in her songs so she can write anthems for her Little Monsters, that ragtag group of queers, misfits, outcasts, and rough kids who she calls her own. Gaga is hardly insincere -- this isn’t an act, she’s been instrumental as a gay rights activist -- but her conquistador stance ironically reduces Born This Way to a collection of songs about fashion, freaks, and religion, with the occasional respite arriving via German unicorns. Unfortunately, this doesn’t play quite as weird as it reads. Whatever performance art shock Gaga had on The Fame/The Fame Monster has turned into pure theater. Her drama club ambition to marry rock & roll rebellion with her disco beats turns Born This Way into Like a Prayer by way of Bat Out of Hell. Gaga has chosen not to dig under the skin. She’s quite content to state her themes then let them be, using them as the connecting thread on an ‘80s pastiche set to a relentless Eurotrash throb. Echoes of Whitney Houston, Pat Benatar, and Bruce Springsteen -- whose longtime running partner Clarence Clemons blows sax on two songs --- can be heard throughout, but it is naturally Madonna who is the cornerstone, giving Gaga the “Express Yourself” melody -- which is reworked on no less than three songs on the Deluxe Edition (and really, with an album this over the top, why skimp with the standard edition?) -- and a pop precedent for Catholic guilt. Lady Gaga doesn’t so much rip off Madonna as knowingly recontextualize the Material Girl for a post-modern collage, the sly similarities offering tangible reminders that Gaga is the heir to the diva throne. And Born This Way does solidify her standing as something of a pop visionary, although Gaga is a little bit too eager to embrace her role as messiah, letting her skills as a songwriter slide ever so slightly. Gaga’s true gift is her considerable dexterity at delivering the basics. Unlike so many of her peers, she does not cut and paste her tracks digitally, she constructs from the chords up, then accessorizes at will. She doesn’t abandon this sensibility on Born This Way, but she does take it for granted, never pushing her compositions or productions into unpredictable territory. She serves up the expected, which can be quite satisfying: “Marry the Night” glistens with a neon pulse, “Born This Way” has a giddiness to its self-importance, “Judas” turns “Alejandro” into towering gothic disco, she achieves her metal-disco fusion on “Bad Kids,” and she even shows vulnerability on “Yoü and I.” All well and good, and all very entertaining, but this is an album that’s meant to be more: it’s intended to be a soundtrack to a way of life, but it winds up playing as a collection of songs.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	14	CD	2026-01-18 21:50:52.974406	2

Often, the album features dialogue ripped from the screen -- a full 15 tracks, actually, amounting to seven minutes of this 74-minute album -- which means A Star Is Born almost plays like a Disney record from the '60s or '70s: it's designed to tide listeners over until they get a chance to see the movie again. Of course, A Star Is Born is a musical, so its soundtrack is filled with full-fledged songs, all of which serve the story that the dialogue gooses along. Strip out the distracting dialogue tracks and the plot of A Star Is Born is still evident, as the music moves from the grungy Americana of Cooper's character, through his affecting duets with Lady Gaga, toward her flashy pop, and then culminating with "I'll Never Love Again," the song where the two estranged lovers reunite. Each of these phases is expertly executed. Lukas Nelson assists Cooper in the rangy grunge of "Black Eyes," while Jason Isbell's spare "Maybe It's Time" is an affecting slice of Americana. The second stage, where Gaga is duetting with Cooper, fuses their sensibilities seamlessly, particularly on the aching ballad "Shallow" and loping country-rock of "Music to My Eyes," which was co-written by Nelson and Gaga. Her pop section plays like its own EP, and it's snappy, stylish, and savvy, particularly on the retro-disco of "Why Did You Do That?" and soulful "Heal Me." All the songs make sense narratively and on their own, so they hold together well and amount to a first-rate soundtrack.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	32	CD	2026-01-18 21:50:52.974407	2

An arty, self-assured singer with a style that falls somewhere between Beyoncé and Björk, Martinez first came to the public's attention singing Britney Spears' "Toxic" as a contestant on the third season of NBC's The Voice. Perhaps not surprisingly, then, her songs also fit nicely next to the work of contemporaries like Lorde and Lana Del Rey. As with Dollhouse, aiding Martinez on Cry Baby are a handful of hip-hop and pop-steeped producers including Kinetics & One Love (B.o.B, Pitbull, Neon Hitch), SmarterChild (Krewella, Usher, Tori Kelly), and Frequency (Eminem, Royce da 5'9", Slaughterhouse).

Again at the center of the album is Martinez's alter ego "Cry Baby," the titular character introduced on her 2015 debut. As with that album, K-12 features songtitles inspired by school-age themes including "Show & Tell," "Nurse's Office," and "Wheels on the Bus," albeit with many of the tracks working as metaphors for more turbulent adult issues. For example, the lyrical and dreamy "Strawberry Shortcake" is both about going through puberty and struggling with the male gaze. Similarly, on "Show and Tell," Martinez references the time-honored kindergarten activity in order to dig deeper into the toxic love/hate relationship between artist and fan. She sings, "Harsh words if you don't get a pic with me/Buy and sell like I'm a product to society." Aiding Martinez with her highly conceptual pop sound is longtime associate producer/songwriter Michael Keenan, who also worked on Cry Baby. Also returning is Cry Baby alum One Love (aka Tim Sommers) for the moody "Drama Club." Musically speaking, K-12 has the same hip-hop and R&B underpinnings that Martinez favored on Cry Baby, with tracks like the aforementioned "Drama Club," "The Principle," and "Detention" showcasing her detached, periodically down-pitched babydoll vocals and a penchant for what sounds like midtempo xylophone and African finger-piano grooves. That said, it's also a more sophisticated production, with better hooks showcasing Martinez's growth as a songwriter. It's a sound that ably straddles the line between Lana Del Rey's disaffected noir style and Mike Posner's more confessional pop. Notably, the album also arrives in tandem with a colorfully eye-popping short film, written and directed by Martinez, that draws inspiration from her songs. While the album certainly works independently of the film, K-12 plays at a cinematically measured pace, perfect for both afterschool and afterhours listening.© Matt Collar /TiVo	9	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:50:56.762616	1

Arriving on the heels of a two-year hiatus, the record is the singer's first not to feature her empath "Cry Baby" persona, the focus of both 2015's Cry Baby and 2019's K-12. Thematically, PORTALS is an album about death and rebirth with songs that speak to Martinez's ongoing knack for reinventing her sci-fantasy baby girl aesthetic in ever more musically nuanced and diaristic ways. Produced with collaborator C.J. Baran, PORTALS sounds similar to her past work, a textural blend of electronic grooves and instrumentation that she smartly blends with more organic strings, woody bass, and sundry other analog instruments. Vocally, Martinez also still has her distinctively cherubic style, like an anime alien who listened to a lot of Feist and Rihanna. That said, there's a growing maturity to her work and never a sense that she's not in complete control of what she's creating. This is perhaps best expressed on the opening "DEATH," a moody, orchestral-tinged anthem that feels like it's about reclaiming one's emotions after a difficult breakup. While some of PORTALS can sometimes lean heavily into midtempo, minor-key electronica, there are moments of thrilling alt-rock anthemics, including the Garbage-esque "BATTLE OF THE LARYNX" with its chugging guitar riff and tidal wave synths. There's also "VOID," which sounds something like Billie Eilish crossed with the Cure. Equally compelling is "MOON CYCLE," in which Martinez takes a strong, witchy feminist stance, singing, "I could win a fight on my period/Matter of fact, right now, I could build a pyramid/You messing with my cycle, that is dangerous."© Matt Collar /TiVo	39	CD	2026-01-18 21:51:08.742902	2

An arty, self-assured singer with a style that falls somewhere between Beyoncé and Björk, Martinez first came to the public's attention singing Britney Spears' "Toxic" as a contestant on the third season of NBC's The Voice. Perhaps not surprisingly, then, her songs also fit nicely next to the work of contemporaries like Lorde and Lana Del Rey. As with Dollhouse, aiding Martinez on Cry Baby are a handful of hip-hop and pop-steeped producers including Kinetics & One Love (B.o.B, Pitbull, Neon Hitch), SmarterChild (Krewella, Usher, Tori Kelly), and Frequency (Eminem, Royce da 5'9", Slaughterhouse). Featured on Cry Baby are the singles "Sippy Cup," "Soap," and "Pity Party."© Matt Collar /TiVo	19	CD	2026-01-18 21:51:08.742904	2
138320	K-12	Melanie Martinez	290.69	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/kc/rd/b8u3b7x3trdkc_600.jpg	qobuz:64032590|b8u3b7x3trdkc	The sophomore full-length album from Melanie Martinez, 2019's K-12, finds the arty pop singer offering yet more darkly emotive anthems centered on adolescence and growing up. Again at the center of the album is Martinez's alter ego "Cry Baby," the titular character introduced on her 2015 debut. As with that album, K-12 features songtitles inspired by school-age themes including "Show & Tell," "Nurse's Office," and "Wheels on the Bus," albeit with many of the tracks working as metaphors for more turbulent adult issues. For example, the lyrical and dreamy "Strawberry Shortcake" is both about going through puberty and struggling with the male gaze. Similarly, on "Show and Tell," Martinez references the time-honored kindergarten activity in order to dig deeper into the toxic love/hate relationship between artist and fan. She sings, "Harsh words if you don't get a pic with me/Buy and sell like I'm a product to society." Aiding Martinez with her highly conceptual pop sound is longtime associate producer/songwriter Michael Keenan, who also worked on Cry Baby. Also returning is Cry Baby alum One Love (aka Tim Sommers) for the moody "Drama Club." Musically speaking, K-12 has the same hip-hop and R&B underpinnings that Martinez favored on Cry Baby, with tracks like the aforementioned "Drama Club," "The Principle," and "Detention" showcasing her detached, periodically down-pitched babydoll vocals and a penchant for what sounds like midtempo xylophone and African finger-piano grooves. That said, it's also a more sophisticated production, with better hooks showcasing Martinez's growth as a songwriter. It's a sound that ably straddles the line between Lana Del Rey's disaffected noir style and Mike Posner's more confessional pop. Notably, the album also arrives in tandem with a colorfully eye-popping short film, written and directed by Martinez, that draws inspiration from her songs. While the album certainly works independently of the film, K-12 plays at a cinematically measured pace, perfect for both afterschool and afterhours listening.© Matt Collar /TiVo	31	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:51:08.742904	1

Third album Planet Her puts the emphasis on her versatility and anything-goes stylistic blend, applying even slicker production values to her already radio-friendly sound. The record swings wildly, tackling different sounds almost song to song. Album opener "Woman" is a sultry and bass-heavy track that pulses with a psuedo-Caribbean groove before throwing in the curveball of a Kendrick Lamar-esque rap flow halfway in. The gears switch quickly to hooky rap-singing on the melodic Young Thug-assisted earworm "Payday," slick cosmic R&B on "You Right," featuring a cameo verse from the Weeknd, vaporous indie-adjacent electronic sounds on "Been Like This," and sugary balladry meeting booming bass thumps on the lovestruck yearning of "I Don't Do Drugs" featuring Ariana Grande. All of Doja Cat's various creative wanderings are held together seamlessly by incredibly clean and detail-rich production. Each of her unexpected left turns and potentially clashing marriages of styles are guided into easy landings with expertly placed rhythmic dropouts, ear-catching synth flourishes, and inventive instrumental moves that fill any space that could be awkward or uneven in less-skilled hands. Planet Her's dazzling construction is matched by Doja Cat's controlled performances and a personality that can deliver hypersexualized brags and expressions of tenderness and fragility with the same power. Some of the album's best moments hold space for both, like the lewd yet sweet drift of "Love to Dream," and the pitch-perfect summer anthem "Kiss Me More," which closes out its celebration of lust and the giddy excitement of brand-new love with a verse from SZA. Doja Cat tries something new with almost every orbit on Planet Her. When the production magic keeps up with her boundless spirit, the songs reach a unique hotspot of fun and infectiousness that makes all of Doja Cat's disparate impulses gel into an exhilarating whole.© Fred Thomas /TiVo	17	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:51:40.79691	1
696868	Hurry Up Tomorrow	The Weeknd	188.57	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/fa/yt/r0mco98f1ytfa_600.jpg	qobuz:315416312|r0mco98f1ytfa	The Weeknd is trapped somewhere between death and rebirth on Hurry Up Tomorrow, his sixth and potentially final album. Though a lot of the experimental R&B and futuristic pop made by Abel Tesfaye as the Weeknd on his climb to worldwide fame has been heavy, moody, fatalistic, and looking towards dire endings, there's a cloud of finality that hangs aggressively and heavy-handedly over Hurry Up Tomorrow. Nearly every song here focuses on the rigors of fame, with lyrics returning time and again to being drained by the demands of touring, wanting out, being in too deep, and generally being ready to end it all. This can come off as utter desperation or self-indulgent metaphor depending on the delivery, but Tesfaye takes every opportunity to impress upon his audience that this is the end. Luckily, these depressing themes are wrapped in the same brilliant production, shiny synths, and intelligent song construction as the best of the Weeknd's output, resulting in a somewhat conflicting listen. Spending the album's 84-minute run time listening to a lesser artist go on and on about how rough his life of opulence and luxury is would be an utter slog, but Hurry Up Tomorrow is paced with calculation to keep things moving. The stabbing synth tones and darkly enchanting melodies of "Cry for Me" recall earlier Weeknd hits, and quickly transition into the quasi-Brazilian bump of "São Paulo," which is completed by an electric vocal hook from Anitta. Glum ballad "Reflections Laughing" builds in intensity until what began as a fairly minimal song becomes a cinematic experience, tapping into both the over-the-top grandeur of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy and the edgy nocturnal atmosphere of the Chromatics or Tesfaye's frequent producer and collaborator Oneohtrix Point Never. The seriousness rarely wavers throughout Hurry Up Tomorrow, but moments like the elastic bump of vaporous rap tune "Timeless" with Playboi Carti, the sunny pop of "Give Me Mercy," and the knowing re-creation of Michael Jackson's "Thriller" groove on the second half of "Wake Me Up" break up what could easily become a monotonous drag. Even still, there's just a little bit too much moping to handle as Tesfaye describes his demise (metaphorical, literal, conceptual, the death of the character that is "The Weeknd," and more) from every angle. Lana Del Rey coos in the shadows on "The Abyss" and a Giorgio Moroder sample attempts to enliven "Big Sleep," but every flash of excitement bleeds into a muted whole. Ultimately, Hurry Up Tomorrow achieves its objective of ceremoniously ending the Weeknd. It's a flawlessly executed document of pristine production and incremental bursts of verve and joy to keep the music from dissolving into its own atmosphere. The challenge here, however, is finding the right mood to appreciate the Weeknd's lengthy and elaborate funeral for himself.© Fred Thomas /TiVo	17	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:55:50.061842	1
755082	Ultraviolence	Lana Del Rey	132.31	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/68/65/0060253786568_600.jpg	qobuz:17342731|0060253786568	The maelstrom of hype surrounding self-modeled Hollywood pop star Lana Del Rey's 2012 breakthrough album, Born to Die, found critics, listeners, and pop culture aficionados divided about her detached, hyper-stylized approach to every aspect of her music and public persona. What managed to get overlooked by many was that Born to Die made such a polarizing impression because it actually offered something that didn't sound like anything else. Del Rey's sultry, overstated orchestral pop recast her as some sort of vaguely imagined chanteuse for a generation raised on Adderall and the Internet, with heavy doses of Twin Peaks atmosphere adding a creepy sheen to intentionally vapid (and undeniably catchy) radio hits. Follow-up album Ultraviolence shifts gears considerably, building a thick, slow-moving atmosphere with its languid songs and opulent arrangements. Gone are the big beats and glossy production that resulted in tracks like "Summertime Sadness." Instead, Ultraviolence begins with the protracted, rolling melancholia of "Cruel World," nearly seven minutes of what feels like a sad, reverb-drenched daydream. The song sets the stage for the rest of the album, which simmers with a haunted, yearning feeling but never boils over. Even the most pop-friendly moments here are steeped in patient, jazz-inflected moodiness, as with the sad-eyed longing of "Shades of Cool" or the unexpected tempo changes that connect the slinky verses of single "West Coast" to their syrupy, swaying choruses. Production from the Black Keys' Dan Auerbach might have something to do with the metered restraint that permeates the album, with songs like "Sad Girl" carrying some of the slow-burning touches of greasy blues-rock Auerbach is known for. A few puzzling moments break up the continuity of the album. The somewhat hooky elements of "Brooklyn Baby" can't quite rise above its disjointed song structure and cringeable lyrics that could be taken either as mockery of the hipster lifestyle or self-parody. "Money Power Glory" steps briefly out of the overall dreamscape of the album, sounding like a tossed-off outtake from the Born to Die sessions. Despite these mild missteps, Ultraviolence thrives for the most part in its density, meant clearly to be absorbed as an entire experience, with even its weaker pieces contributing to a mood that's consumptive, sexy, and as eerie as big-budget pop music gets. Del Rey's loudest detractors criticized her music as a hollow, cliché-ridden product designed by the music industry and lacking the type of substance that makes real pop stars pop. Ultraviolence asserts that as a songwriter, she has complete control of her craft, deciding on songs far less flashy or immediate but still uniquely captivating. As these songs shift her sound into more mature and nuanced places, it becomes clear that every deadpan affectation, lispy lyric, and overblown allusion to desperate living has been a knowing move in the creation of the strange, beguiling character -- and sonic experience -- we know as Lana Del Rey.© Fred Thomas /TiVo	13	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:18.428526	1
965436	COWBOY CARTER	Beyoncé	85.67	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/xc/9v/uui32wudi9vxc_600.jpg	qobuz:259592461|uui32wudi9vxc	This may be the "Beyoncé goes country" record—but, in truth, she's always been here. A Houston native and rodeo fan, she released countrified "Daddy Lessons" on 2016's Lemonade then upped the ante with a Chicks remix that was met with industry backlash. But no one puts Beyoncé in a corner, and Cowboy Carter is her gracious "told ya so" moment. First single "Texas Hold 'Em" saw her become the first Black woman to top Billboard's Hot Country chart, and it's a joy: echoing the Chicks' and Shania's C&W pop, but also Rhiannon Giddens' mountain folk (that's her playing banjo on the song) as well as all-American sweet soul music. The excellent Raphael Saadiq is a co-writer, and his touch shows. And damned if the affecting ballad "16 Carriages"—grand in the "Halo" tradition—doesn't sound like an autobiographical recounting of Beyoncé's career start as a teen. "At fifteen, the innocence was gone astray/ Had to take care of home at an early age/ I saw Mama cryin', I saw Daddy lyin'/ Had to sacrifice and leave my fears behind," she sings, chillingly, against crackling percussion and Robert Randolph's pedal steel. No wonder Dolly Parton blessed the cover of "Jolene," intro-ing that song with a comparison of her own titular character to the notorious Becky with the good hair. Beyoncé layers on the twang and tweaks the lyrics: "Jolene, I know I'm a queen, Jolene/ I'm still a Creole banjee bitch from Louisianne (don't try me)." Willie Nelson shows up as a radio DJ spinning samples from Sister Rosetta Tharpe and Son House. "Spaghettii" opens with a spoken intro from pioneer Linda Martell—the first Black woman to perform on the Grand Ole Opry, in 1969, but who also faced racism on the road and returned to South Carolina to be a bus driver. Over drill beats, Beyoncé shows off her rap skills in a stunning display ("Just a fishin' expedition, dumb admission/ In the kitchen, cookin' up them chickens/ Extra leg, but I ain't even tryna kick it/ Cunty, country, petty, petty, petty/ All the same to me, Plain Jane, spaghetti"), joined by Shaboozey. He also guests, as does Pharrell, on wild bull ride "Sweet Honey Buckiin,'" which starts with Bey crooning Patsy Cline's "I Fall to Pieces." The Cowboy Carter guest list is dizzying: rising star Willie Jones (gospel-inflected "Just for Fun"), Miley Cyrus (ride-or-die R&B ballad "II Most Wanted"), Gary Clark Jr. (sun-streaked yacht rocker "Bodyguard"). Post Malone joins the party for slow-burn flirt "Levii's Jeans," produced by The-Dream and Nile Rodgers. A goosebump-inducing cover of The Beatles' "Blackbird" showcases four of the most exciting young Black women in country music right now: Tanner Adell, Brittney Spencer, Tiera Kennedy and Reyna Roberts. There are sweet lullabies ("Protector"), giddy-up grind ("Tyrant") and Beyoncé singing a bit of the aria "Caro Mio Ben" ("Daughter"). And "Ya Ya" is an absolute  jaw-dropper—packed with Tina Turner energy and interpolations of Nancy Sinatra and the Beach Boys—that slides into a snippet of Chuck Berry's "Oh Louisiana" reworked as a psychedelic blues fever dream.  © Shelly Ridenour/Qobuz	21	CD	2026-01-18 21:59:47.766775	2
115847	Vie	Doja Cat	215.34	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/na/3n/v04ccqbl13nna_600.jpg	qobuz:352675996|v04ccqbl13nna	After her hits Planet Her (2021) and Scarlet (2023), Doja Cat is back with Vie, a record whose undeniably 80’s sound would have made it right at home on the soundtrack to GTA Vice City. The glitzy drum machines and enormous synthesizers are out in full force, and the decade’s most iconic samples abound. An entire army of producers sample clips from some of the decade’s most iconic films, like Knight Rider (1982) on the track “AAAH MEN!” or How Do You Attract A Man (1985) on “All Mine.” Doja Cat’s penchant for rap makes room for ultra-contemporary bubblegum pop and hints of R&B and nu-soul, underlying genres that add even more color to Vie. She sings about hot girl problems on “Gorgeous,” a track that’s equal parts stuck-up and sensitive, reflecting on beauty and everything that comes along with it—in her case, public scrutiny. Behind this lightness lies the misogynistic injunction to always appear untouchable. Musically far more sophisticated than it may seem at first, this latest release from Doja Cat follows very contemporary rules in spite of all the retro elements, going the way of Ariana Grande or Sabrina Carpenter, but still getting away scot free from the highly competitive world of pop music in the era of streaming. © Brice Miclet/Qobuz	19	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:51:40.796913	1

Hot off the back of much media and fan speculation, Doja isn't afraid to speak out this time around, and no one is safe. Earlier in 2023, the pop superstar was losing followers by the boatload stating "seeing these people unfollow me makes me feel like I've defeated a large beast that's been holding me down for so long… now I can reconnect with people who really matter and love me for who I am." This "large beast" is most clearly addressed on the hard-hitting track "Demons," a Doja-fied version of something you may have found on Tyler the Creator's revolutionary 2011 album Goblin: "Lots of people that were sleeping say I rap now/ Lots of people's hopes and dreams are finally trashed now." And rap she does.Proudly boasting "no features" on her social media, this album is 100% Doja Cat; she didn't come to play and she has a lot to say. From her laid-back flow on "Balut" where she addresses her amateur contemporaries to "Wet Vagina" where she points out her newfound status in the fashion world, it is always great to see a female artist who unashamedly backs herself like no other. Even on "Attention" she brings up the fact that the media tried to pin her against fellow rap icon and personal influence Nicki Minaj ("'Why she think she Nicki M? She think she hot shit'/ Huh, I never gave a F, go stir the pot bitch").Beyond her protean flow, Doja's knack for writing flaming hot bars really shines on Scarlet. She is a master of the metaphor and the double entendre. On "Balut" she raps "Make the hoe kneel/ She kill it like an O'Neal," using "she kill it" as a homophone for Shaquille (O'Neal). The production also speaks for the album's versatility, with credits including hip-hop producer legend Rogét Chahayed, London on Da Track, Beat Butcha, Jay Versace and f a l l e n. Scarlet was written between Doja's regular writing schedule and a 10 day Malibu treat.  As a result, half of the album has a different aura and message from the other. Tracks like "Attention" and "Paint the Town Red" have an ultra cool laissez-faire Doja is known for and "Demons," "Wet Vagina," "Fuck the Girls FTG" and "Balut" all have a certain bite recalling her early SoundCloud rap days. The vibe completely switches to something more relaxed and "sing-songy" (think her previous album) on tracks like "Gun" and "Go Off" (produced by  f a l l e n, who also worked on Planet Her), and can also be felt on "97," "Agora Hills," "Can't Wait" and "Love Life." Whilst this album has a lot to offer and there is something for everyone, one might experience a little less whiplash if a few songs were dropped from the 15-deep tracklist.  Regardless, Doja Cat has certainly earned the title of the Princess of Rap and is deserving of the recognition as a truly talented multi-faceted artist and pop-culture icon.

271553	Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded	Rihanna	88.74	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/42/21/0060251772142_600.jpg	qobuz:742806|0060251772142	When you've released a pair of albums containing a few monster singles and a considerable amount of unsteady, unassured material, why mess around the third time out? From beginning to end, Good Girl Gone Bad is as pop as pop gets in 2007, each one of its 12 songs a potential hit in some territory. Unlike Music of the Sun or A Girl Like Me, neither Caribbean flavorings nor ballad ODs are part of the script, and there isn't an attempt to make something as theatrical as "Unfaithful." There is, however, another '80s hit involved: just as "SOS" appropriated Soft Cell's version of "Tainted Love," "Shut Up and Drive" turns New Order's "Blue Monday" into a sleek, forthcoming proposition, one that is as undeniable and rocking as Sugababes' 2002 U.K. smash "Freak Like Me" (a cover of Adina Howard's 1995 hit that swiped from another '80s single, Gary Numan's "Are Friends Electric?"). "Shut Up and Drive" is part of an all-upbeat opening sequence that carries through five songs. Rihanna knows exactly what she wants and is in total control at all times, even when she's throwing things and proclaiming "I'm a fight a man" amid marching percussion and synthesizers set on "scare" during "Breakin' Dishes." The album's lead song and lead single, "Umbrella," is her best to date, delivering mammoth if spacious drums, a towering backdrop during the chorus, and vocals that are somehow totally convincing without sounding all that impassioned -- an ideal spot between trying too hard and boredom, like she might've been on her 20th take, which only adds to the song's charm. The album's second half is relatively varied and a little heavier on acoustic guitar use, but it's not lacking additional standouts. Three consecutive Timbaland productions, including one suited for a black college marching band and another that effectively pulls the romantically codependent heartstrings, enhance the album rather than make it more scattered.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	27	CD	2026-01-18 21:51:43.256286	2
826337	For You	Selena Gomez	259.89	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/07/19/0005008731907_600.jpg	qobuz:20594095|0005008731907	Selena Gomez has been a lot of things in her short career -- a Disney star, a steady source of tabloid fodder, an aspiring actress -- but what sometimes gets overlooked is that, since 2009, she's been making really good records that put her right at the top of her generation of pop singers. For You collects some of the biggest singles and best songs from her four albums, her "duet" with Selena ("Bidi Bidi Bom Bom"), and a couple new songs as well. At her best, Gomez has a light and nimble vocal style that fits into a wide variety of styles and always delivers just the right level of emotion without ever overselling. She feels natural delivering sweet pop anthems like "Who Says," hitting the sad disco on "Round & Round," or rocking out a little on "Falling Down." Mostly, though, she sticks to danceable, slightly melancholic dance pop, and this collection makes clear just how good she is at it. The only ballad included is the newly recorded, very adult and real-sounding "The Heart Wants What It Wants," and she acquits herself well here too. The other new track is "Do It," a rollicking midtempo pop jam that's also very "adult," to the point that any preteens checking it out may need to have a few things explained to them. Gomez might not be a belter or have the electric personality of some of her contemporaries; what she does possess is style, a winning voice, and lots of good songs -- as For You proves again and again.© Tim Sendra /TiVo	15	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:54:19.631869	1
362126	ANTI	Rihanna	199.41	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/70/06/0085136500670_600.jpg	qobuz:29872389|0085136500670	Anti existed as an album cycle before it existed as an album -- arguably long before Rihanna knew what form her eighth album would take, either. Work on Anti began in the autumn of 2014 and proceeded in semi-public, progress being measured in Instagram posts and tweets, along with intermittent singles, each released to white-hot anticipation but none metamorphosing into massive hits. When Anti finally appeared in January 2016 -- three years after Unapologetic and months later than expected -- it bore none of these 2015 singles, a move that suggests a tacit acknowledgment that neither the curiously muted Kanye West and Paul McCartney collaboration "FourFiveSeconds" nor the unrestrained roar of "Bitch Better Have My Money" functioned as appropriate anchors for the album. Then again, neither would've felt at home on the cloistered Anti, the first of Rihanna's records to feel constructed as a front-to-back album. Such a sustained sensibility distinguishes Anti from its predecessors, records where album cuts often felt like afterthoughts. That's not the case with Anti. This is an album whose heart lies within its deep cuts. Mood matters more than either hooks or rhythm: it's a subdued, simmering affair, its songs subtly shaded yet interlocked to create a vibe caught halfway between heartbreak and ennui. The latter has always been a specialty of Rihanna -- her distance from her material was at once appealing and alienating -- so hearing her lean into "Love on the Brain" and "Higher" is something of a revelation: her voice is hoarse and ravaged, yet she's also controlled and precise, knowing how to hone these imperfections so her performance echoes classic soul while feeling fresh. These songs come at the end of the album, after a series of songs that drift and wonder, the sound of an artist trying to figure out not only what her album is but who she is. By the end of Anti, Rihanna may not arrive at any definitive conclusions about her art but she's allowed herself to be unguarded and anti-commercial, resulting in her most compelling record to date.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	13	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:51:55.617984	1
766510	Loud	Rihanna	49.68	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/34/29/0060252782934_600.jpg	qobuz:3951277|0060252782934	Loud would not sound quite so slapdash if it did not follow Good Girl Gone Bad, one of the best pop albums of its decade, and Rated R, one of the most fascinating pop albums of the same time frame. This album, released less than a year after the latter, also has the misfortune of arriving with no fanfare; a dramatic intro proclaiming “The wait is ova,” à la Rated R's opening track, would be silly. Even without considering the weight of what it follows, there’s no getting past the notion that Loud is as uneven as Rihanna’s first two albums. It’s more an unfocused assortment of poor-to-solid songs than a unified set. The predatory StarGate/Sandy Vee-produced dance-pop (“S&M,” “Only Girl [In the World]”) is what works best here. Though neither one can touch “Rude Boy,” they do efficiently balance Rihanna’s playful and sinister sides. One song that sounds nothing like anything else in Rihanna’s past is “Skin,” a contender for anti-gravity slow jam of 2010 -- a match for Trey Songz's “Red Lipstick” and Usher’s “Mars vs Venus.” The low points -- the cluttered “Complicated,” the unfinished-sounding Nicki Minaj collaboration “Raining Men,” the overwrought rock weeper “California King Bed” -- weigh the album down, making it resemble a fourth-quarter stopgap as Rihanna prepares her next truly eventful release. There’s just enough quality content to maintain her visibility.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	16	CD	2026-01-18 21:51:55.617987	2
912907	Unapologetic	Rihanna	77.63	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/0b/6r/n5ax5q9496r0b_600.jpg	qobuz:54360406|n5ax5q9496r0b	In 2012, right on schedule, Rihanna delivered her fourth annual November album. The singer took a different route with the lead single. She didn't go with a dramatic ballad like "Russian Roulette" or a big dance number like "Only Girl (In the World)" and "We Found Love." Instead, the nod went to a midtempo pop ballad, "Diamonds" -- as in "We're like diamonds in the sky" (rather than stars in a mine), a simple and effective, light in meaning yet massive in sonics, quasi-processional. Even with that change of pace, the possibility of it signaling an overall change in direction was slight. Not only is Unapologetic just as varied as Rihanna's past albums -- it's another timely refresh of contemporary pop music -- but it's a little more exploratory and a whole lot deeper, too. Continuing the trend that began on Rated R, Rihanna's at her best when she's flaunting. This goes for "Pour It Up," a characteristically chilly and booming Mike Will collaboration that might as well be a sequel to "Bandz a Make Her Dance," the producer's hit with Juicy J. Wrapped in a serene sneer, Rihanna's trash talk is something else. Moments such as that one are so convincing that the few everywoman heart-on-sleeve songs -- with the exception of the massive, slamming, wailing power ballad that is "What Now" -- don't sound all that natural. Two of the album's most intriguing, contrasting, and not-so-everywoman tracks appear consecutively during the latter half. Both of them were written and produced by Terius "The-Dream" Nash and Carlos "Los" McKinney. "Nobody's Business," flecked with elements from Michael Jackson's "The Way You Make Me Feel," is a beaming if somewhat belligerent disco-house duet with Chris Brown. Rihanna's partner proposes to make out in a Lexus prior to proclaiming that the relationship "ain't nobody's business." The celebration is followed by "Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary," conjoined songs with a wide theatrical scope akin to that of the-Dream's own "Nikki, Pt. 2/Abyss." Over a swelling and receding production with echoes of Kim Carnes' "Bette Davis' Eyes," Rihanna mourns ("Felt like love struck me in the night/I pray that love don't strike twice"), then confesses ("Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change"), then surrenders ("I'm prepared to die in the moment"). Perhaps no one should read anything into it. The same could be said of "No Love Allowed," which comes along a little later. Even with a captivating, drum-less reggae groove, it's hard to hear lines like "Your love hit me to the core" and "It's so foolish how you keep me wanting more" and think that she's fine and could be singing about anyone. While this is a fine, if uneven album, the only way to enjoy a significant portion of it is by taking it as pure entertainment. Good luck.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	24	CD	2026-01-18 21:51:55.617987	2
385921	Talk That Talk	Rihanna	293.09	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/aa/cf/wx1t52qwwcfaa_600.jpg	qobuz:55499997|wx1t52qwwcfaa	Despite sounding rushed to capitalize on fourth quarter sales, 2010’s Loud proved that Rihanna’s reign indeed would not let up. The album’s first three singles topped the Hot 100. A fourth one merely went Top Ten. Just as Loud was losing its grip, during the fourth quarter of 2011, Rihanna fired again with another number one single, “We Found Love” -- its success more likely due to the singer’s ecstatic vocal than Calvin Harris' shrill, plinky production. While Talk That Talk is built like another singles-chart-devouring machine, it’s both more rounded and less random than Loud. “We Found Love” and “Where Have You Been” -- the latter with a quote from Geoff Mack's “I’ve Been Everywhere” and echoes of the chorus from Adele’s “Rolling in the Deep” -- function as place-holding dance tracks, and there are a couple empty anthems and ballads in the drippy “We All Want Love” and the bombastic “Farewell.” It’s the darker and dirty-minded material that tends to be most effective -- where Rihanna is more alive and believable, where her collaborators provide the most adventurous productions. In the Bangladesh-produced “Cockiness (Love It),” one of the most hypnotic and wicked beats of the last decade, Rihanna absolutely relishes the chance to sing-taunt “Suck my cockiness, swallow my persuasion.” Two of Stargate and Esther Dean's three contributions -- the desperate, xx-sampling “Drunk on Love“ (“Nothing can sober me up”) and the prowling “Roc Me Out” -- pack more sleek menace than Rated R's “G4L” and Loud’s “S&M.” The album’s best track, however, is the wholly sweet and flirtatious “Watch n’ Learn,” featuring a dizzying Hit-Boy beat -- rat-a-tat snares, swirling/swelling synthesizers, irresistible plucked melodies -- that is even more unique in the context of 2011 pop radio than his work on Kanye West and Jay-Z's “Ni**as in Paris.” Behind Good Girl Gone Bad and Rated R, this is Rihanna's third best album to date.

Even with the realization that it is metaphorical, the song startles with its hesitant gasps, spinning cylinders, and verses that are glacially paced, where a cold piano line and the slight inflections in Rihanna's voice are front and center. And then there’s an audible shudder followed by a discharged bullet -- the abrupt end to one of Rated R’s most restrained moments. It’s not the only instance where Rihanna’s rise in fame, combined with being the victim in the decade’s highest-profile felonious assault, added up to a perfect-storm scenario for a creative overhaul. Rated R is more like Good Girl Gone Evil, or Abused Girl Full of Vengeful Rage, not Good Girl Gone Bad, where the only casualties were some dishes. The closest the set gets to upbeat pop is “Rude Boy,” and by any standard it is stern; needless to say, there is quite a difference between “Can you get it up?” and “You can stand under my umbrella.” Much of this daring album is absolutely over the top, bleak and sleek both lyrically and sonically, but it’s compelling, filled with as many memorably belligerent lines -- two of which, “I pitch with a grenade/Swing away if ya feeling brave” and “I’m such a fuckin’ lady,” set the tone early on -- as a rap album made ripe for dissection. “G4L,” over a low-slung and sleek production, is the most fantastical of all, in which Rihanna leads a band of homicidal women, opening with “I lick the gun when I’m done ‘cause I know that revenge is sweet” and “Any mothaf*cka wanna disrespect/Playin’ with fire finna get you wet.” The breakup song, “Fire Bomb,” even though it is also metaphorical, is a close second in terms of lyrical extremity: “I just wanna set you on fire so I won’t have to burn alone.” Some of the breathers -- the songs that are less intense -- hold the album back since Rihanna sounds detached from them. The one exception is the wistful, bittersweet “Photographs,” a rare instance of the singer dropping her guard, but it really sticks out since it is surrounded by material that has her taking the variably authentic roles of abused lover, dominatrix, and murderer. Whether the album seems ridiculous or spectacular (or both), Rihanna's complete immersion in the majority of the songs cannot be disputed. That is the one thing that is not up for debate.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	15	CD	2026-01-18 21:51:55.617988	2
363742	Music Of The Sun	Rihanna	378.45	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/16/26/0060249882616_600.jpg	qobuz:3870785|0060249882616	Given the proliferation of young and beautiful urban dance-pop divas dominating the radio and music video airwaves in 2005, it initially was tempting to discount Rihanna as yet another Beyoncé-Ciara-Ashanti cash-in. But like her Def Jam labelmate Teairra Mari -- another young and beautiful urban dance-pop diva who emerged out of nowhere in 2005 -- Rihanna is winsome rather than wannabe, thanks in no small part to her producers. Just as Teairra Mari benefited greatly from irresistibly shrewd beat-making on her debut album, Rihanna benefits from the knowing production work of Syndicated Rhythm Productions, aka Evan Rogers and Carl Sturken, who together produced a laundry list of contemporary teen pop sensations during the prior decade. What these guys do that's so irresistibly shrewd is synthesize Caribbean rhythms and beats with standard-issue urban dance-pop: Caribbean-inflected urban, if you will. So while a song like "Pon de Replay" -- to pick the most obvious exhibit -- is driven by booming dancehall-lite beats and a reggae vocal cadence (and title spelling), it's a simple dance-pop song at its core, with standard English-language singing as well as a can't-miss singalong hook (and a glitzy, urban-style MTV video to boot). The best songs on Music of the Sun follow this appealing template, including the similarly catchy few songs that follow the aforementioned album-opening smash hit: "Here I Go Again," "If It's Lovin' That You Want," and "You Don't Love Me (No, No, No)." As with most albums of this ilk, Music of the Sun descends into faceless slow jams after a while, overall consistency not being among its attributes, but thankfully it picks up the pace toward the end of its 13-song run and concludes on a fun note, with a remix of "Pon de Replay" featuring Elephant Man. The result is one of the more engaging urban dance-pop albums of the year (and one of the most infectious summer jams, for sure), as well as a nice Caribbean primer for those not ready or willing to jump on the increasingly trendy dancehall and reggaeton bandwagons concurrently sweeping through America's more fashionable cities.© Jason Birchmeier /TiVo	23	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:51:55.617988	1
533934	Unapologetic	Rihanna	356.45	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/fc/2v/zhxqsjn8h2vfc_600.jpg	qobuz:54348418|zhxqsjn8h2vfc	In 2012, right on schedule, Rihanna delivered her fourth annual November album. The singer took a different route with the lead single. She didn't go with a dramatic ballad like "Russian Roulette" or a big dance number like "Only Girl (In the World)" and "We Found Love." Instead, the nod went to a midtempo pop ballad, "Diamonds" -- as in "We're like diamonds in the sky" (rather than stars in a mine), a simple and effective, light in meaning yet massive in sonics, quasi-processional. Even with that change of pace, the possibility of it signaling an overall change in direction was slight. Not only is Unapologetic just as varied as Rihanna's past albums -- it's another timely refresh of contemporary pop music -- but it's a little more exploratory and a whole lot deeper, too. Continuing the trend that began on Rated R, Rihanna's at her best when she's flaunting. This goes for "Pour It Up," a characteristically chilly and booming Mike Will collaboration that might as well be a sequel to "Bandz a Make Her Dance," the producer's hit with Juicy J. Wrapped in a serene sneer, Rihanna's trash talk is something else. Moments such as that one are so convincing that the few everywoman heart-on-sleeve songs -- with the exception of the massive, slamming, wailing power ballad that is "What Now" -- don't sound all that natural. Two of the album's most intriguing, contrasting, and not-so-everywoman tracks appear consecutively during the latter half. Both of them were written and produced by Terius "The-Dream" Nash and Carlos "Los" McKinney. "Nobody's Business," flecked with elements from Michael Jackson's "The Way You Make Me Feel," is a beaming if somewhat belligerent disco-house duet with Chris Brown. Rihanna's partner proposes to make out in a Lexus prior to proclaiming that the relationship "ain't nobody's business." The celebration is followed by "Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary," conjoined songs with a wide theatrical scope akin to that of the-Dream's own "Nikki, Pt. 2/Abyss." Over a swelling and receding production with echoes of Kim Carnes' "Bette Davis' Eyes," Rihanna mourns ("Felt like love struck me in the night/I pray that love don't strike twice"), then confesses ("Mother Mary, I swear I wanna change"), then surrenders ("I'm prepared to die in the moment"). Perhaps no one should read anything into it. The same could be said of "No Love Allowed," which comes along a little later. Even with a captivating, drum-less reggae groove, it's hard to hear lines like "Your love hit me to the core" and "It's so foolish how you keep me wanting more" and think that she's fine and could be singing about anyone. While this is a fine, if uneven album, the only way to enjoy a significant portion of it is by taking it as pure entertainment. Good luck.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	31	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:51:55.617988	1

A lavish collaboration with Benny Blanco, Sia Furler, and Stargate, it projects a feeling of recovery and conquest in the wake of a bad relationship or adverse circumstances -- something conveyed with the line "I choose to be happy." Should there ever be a stage production based on Rihanna's catalog, the song -- her tenth Hot 100 number one -- would be a natural choice for the finale.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	34	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:51:55.617989	1

931264	Black Panther: Wakanda Forever - Music From and Inspired By	Rihanna	159.13	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/jc/zf/toolutf4fzfjc_600.jpg	qobuz:184374441|toolutf4fzfjc	Four years after the release of the twin-threat blockbuster film and album, the team behind Marvel Studios' Black Panther returned with a sequel and its accompanying soundtrack, Black Panther: Wakanda Forever. Still reeling from the passing of actor Chadwick Boseman -- both in real life and onscreen -- they managed to honor his legacy and push the character's story forward in respectful and appropriately mournful fashion. The songs follow suit, setting a somber and reflective tone that is punctuated by moments of celebration and an eye to the future. Split between two cultures that inspired the fictional kingdoms of Talokan (Mayan) and Wakanda (Nigeria), director Ryan Coogler and producer Ludwig Göransson curated a diverse set to support the film, capturing attention with global names (Rihanna, Future, Burna Boy, Stormzy) and showcasing artists that may be lesser-known outside of their genres (DBN Gogo, Vivir Quintana, Foudeqush, Fireboy DML). On the Talokanil/Mesoamerican side, the glimmering synths of "Con La Brisa" capture the shimmer of Namor's submerged home, while "Laayli' kuxa'ano'one" (by Adn Maya Colectivo, Pat Boy, Yaalen K'uj, and All Mayan Winik) and "Mi Pueblo" (by Guadalupe de Jesús Chan Poot) inject Mayan into the mix. Meanwhile, the haunting "Árboles Bajo El Mar" performed by Mare Advertencia Lirika and Vivir Quintana and the urgent "Inframundo" by Blue Rojo provide two of the most riveting vocal performances on the album. Taking it back to Wakanda and the African diaspora, Tems pulls double duty, first by gifting an un-retired Rihanna with the beautiful ballad "Lift Me Up" and then delivering her own take on the Bob Marley classic "No Woman No Cry." South African producer DBN Gogo also provides a pair of hip-shaking tracks from the amapiano subgenre ("Love & Loyalty [Believe]" and "Jele"). Additional highlights include Fireboy DML's uplifting "Coming Back for You"; the hypnotic "Anya Mmiri" from CKay and PinkPantheress; and the pulse-pounding "They Want It, But No" by Tobe and Fat Nwigwe, which matches a similar standout track/scene from the first movie ("Opps" by Vince Staples and Yugen Blakrok). This wealth of diversity makes Wakanda Forever a treasure trove, an immersive experience that uses fictional lands as a means for discovery of real-world cultural traditions.© Neil Z.

345823	A Girl Like Me	Rihanna	272.97	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/97/98/0060249879897_600.jpg	qobuz:735842|0060249879897	Versatile urban dance-pop singer Rihanna gracefully avoids the sophomore slump with A Girl Like Me, a less tropical-flavored, more urban effort than her sun-and-fun debut. Then again, it's hard to be an effervescent island goddess 24-7 when your love life has suffered a crushing blow, something inferred by the numerous heartbreaking ballads included, all of them elegant, mature, and displaying artistic growth. Fans of her brilliant single "Pon de Replay" need not worry, though, as the album kicks off with its equal. Bursting out of the speakers, "SOS" is a sexy club tune that bites the bleepy riff from Soft Cell's "Tainted Love" in a very modern, very exciting mash-up fashion. The crunchy reggae of "Kisses Don't Lie" offers a less revolutionary alternative to Damien Marley's "Welcome to Jamrock." Then the album gets bolder and seamlessly bounces from genre to genre. Attempting things that would make lesser artists crumble, Rihanna goes from a film noir song that elegantly uses murder as a metaphor for cheating ("Unfaithful") to an easy-flowing weekend cruiser ("We Ride"). Even more stunning is the jump from the 2006 prom-song candidate "Final Goodbye" to the totally juiced "Break It Off," where she gives guest star and dancehall king Sean Paul some serious competition. The good but not great redo of "If It's Lovin' That You Want" with Corey Gunz is the only track approaching filler, but it's clearly marked "bonus," so it's a wash. Executive produced by Jay-Z, A Girl Like Me is unsurprisingly polished, yet a richer experience than you'd expect from a singer responsible for the summer jam of 2005, arguably 2006.© David Jeffries /TiVo	28	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:51:55.61799	1

The album’s first three singles topped the Hot 100. A fourth one merely went Top Ten. Just as Loud was losing its grip, during the fourth quarter of 2011, Rihanna fired again with another number one single, “We Found Love” -- its success more likely due to the singer’s ecstatic vocal than Calvin Harris' shrill, plinky production. While Talk That Talk is built like another singles-chart-devouring machine, it’s both more rounded and less random than Loud. “We Found Love” and “Where Have You Been” -- the latter with a quote from Geoff Mack's “I’ve Been Everywhere” and echoes of the chorus from Adele’s “Rolling in the Deep” -- function as place-holding dance tracks, and there are a couple empty anthems and ballads in the drippy “We All Want Love” and the bombastic “Farewell.” It’s the darker and dirty-minded material that tends to be most effective -- where Rihanna is more alive and believable, where her collaborators provide the most adventurous productions. In the Bangladesh-produced “Cockiness (Love It),” one of the most hypnotic and wicked beats of the last decade, Rihanna absolutely relishes the chance to sing-taunt “Suck my cockiness, swallow my persuasion.” Two of Stargate and Esther Dean's three contributions -- the desperate, xx-sampling “Drunk on Love“ (“Nothing can sober me up”) and the prowling “Roc Me Out” -- pack more sleek menace than Rated R's “G4L” and Loud’s “S&M.” The album’s best track, however, is the wholly sweet and flirtatious “Watch n’ Learn,” featuring a dizzying Hit-Boy beat -- rat-a-tat snares, swirling/swelling synthesizers, irresistible plucked melodies -- that is even more unique in the context of 2011 pop radio than his work on Kanye West and Jay-Z's “Ni**as in Paris.” Behind Good Girl Gone Bad and Rated R, this is Rihanna's third best album to date. Minus the fluff, it's close to the latter's equal.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	27	CD	2026-01-18 21:51:55.61799	2
353639	Good Girl Gone Bad	Rihanna	68.83	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/ab/sh/d65iwcvg6shab_600.jpg	qobuz:56028820|d65iwcvg6shab	When you've released a pair of albums containing a few monster singles and a considerable amount of unsteady, unassured material, why mess around the third time out? From beginning to end, Good Girl Gone Bad is as pop as pop gets in 2007, each one of its 12 songs a potential hit in some territory. Unlike Music of the Sun or A Girl Like Me, neither Caribbean flavorings nor ballad ODs are part of the script, and there isn't an attempt to make something as theatrical as "Unfaithful." There is, however, another '80s hit involved: just as "SOS" appropriated Soft Cell's version of "Tainted Love," "Shut Up and Drive" turns New Order's "Blue Monday" into a sleek, forthcoming proposition, one that is as undeniable and rocking as Sugababes' 2002 U.K. smash "Freak Like Me" (a cover of Adina Howard's 1995 hit that swiped from another '80s single, Gary Numan's "Are Friends Electric?"). "Shut Up and Drive" is part of an all-upbeat opening sequence that carries through five songs. Rihanna knows exactly what she wants and is in total control at all times, even when she's throwing things and proclaiming "I'm a fight a man" amid marching percussion and synthesizers set on "scare" during "Breakin' Dishes." The album's lead song and lead single, "Umbrella," is her best to date, delivering mammoth if spacious drums, a towering backdrop during the chorus, and vocals that are somehow totally convincing without sounding all that impassioned -- an ideal spot between trying too hard and boredom, like she might've been on her 20th take, which only adds to the song's charm. The album's second half is relatively varied and a little heavier on acoustic guitar use, but it's not lacking additional standouts. Three consecutive Timbaland productions, including one suited for a black college marching band and another that effectively pulls the romantically codependent heartstrings, enhance the album rather than make it more scattered.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	29	CD	2026-01-18 21:51:55.617991	2

A sheer outspoken force, she capitalised on this reputation by pulling all of her energy into her passion: music and rap. And then came a small miracle, Bodak Yellow. In this track borrowed from rapper Kodak Black, she perfectly showcases her Bronx smooth talk, her boundless energy and her extreme sincerity. Opting to ride a harder line in the vein of Remy Ma or Gangsta Boo, Cardi B asserts herself without leaning towards Nicki Minaj’s pop. Propelled to the status of a brand new and original voice, she has achieved posterity, but the future still holds a few unknowns. In Invasion of Privacy, Cardi B turns all of her qualities into hits. She ticks all the boxes, going from the club formula of DJ Mustard with YG, to motivating minimalism with the Migos. Some choices are less obvious like the ballad with unclassifiable Kehlani, the sun-filled smile with Chance The Rapper, and even this provocative anthem for female freedom with rebellious SZA. All the guests are well chosen, presenting Cardi B under different lights, with widely eclectic atmospheres eventually reaching the radiant Latino tune I Like It. But once again, it’s in her solo performances that the rapper is most convincing, with Get Up 10, a technical and harrowing introduction in the vein of Meek Mill, and Bickenhead, the triumphant and feminist cover of a Project Pat’s classic. In each interpretation, the rapper appears laser focused, outrageous at times, but always extremely articulate, and aptly expressive. Her Latino accent creates an atypical and original rhythm. Each defect of pronunciation is used as a musical weapon in all kinds of situations. Cardi B uses her multi-labelled identity to play on words and try other elaborated internal rhymes, which make her even more enigmatic. Invasion of Privacy comes through as a true open book with maybe just a few torn-off pages, an invitation to learn more even though we already know too much… Always balancing between connivance and honesty, Cardi B successfully passes the always-tough milestone of the first album. And she takes the opportunity to strengthen her proximity with the public through a few mad gestures and an unfiltered writing. As for everybody else, she becomes the highly relevant icon of a new generation seeking a form of virtual authenticity. © Aurélien Chapuis/Qobuz	13	CD	2026-01-18 21:52:01.689034	2

That is, if you merely consumed rap via Hot 97, would you notice she hadn't released an album in seven years? While fans have certainly awaited the follow-up to her 2018 instant classic debut Invasion of Privacy with frothy fervor on social media, it hadn't become a running joke like waiting for Guns N' Roses' Chinese Democracy or a still-yet-to-materialize follow-up to Rihanna's great Anti. Because not only did Belcalis Almánzar never disappear from the cultural landscape, but she also continued to define the genre in the 2020s with standalone songs that were enormous events in themselves ("WAP" and "Up," both included here; the underrated "Bongos") and some of the best cameos of the last decade (Latto's "Put It on Da Floor Again," GloRilla's "Tomorrow 2"). Even Privacy outtake "Money" smoked almost anything else from the era. So her long-brewing sophomore effort feels less like a major cultural comeback than a summary compendium from an essential icon.It remains a thrill whenever Cardi opens her mouth, as on the first single "Imaginary Playerz," where she nerdily boasts, "I seen whole fan pages make avatar changes," or the hyperactive "Bodega Baddie," where she compares herself to Selena. Her emotional content deserves more attention, not least because the bite of her voice sells the heartbreak in lines like "now I've got a ring on every finger but the one on my ring hand" and "you was me but the evil version" from the Offset-lamenting "Be Careful" denouement "Man of Your Word." But Cardi remains at her best over a ferocious cut like "Outside," ("Let me know the time and place/ I'm just tryna ride his face") which grafts a Pop Smoke bassline onto classic NOLA bounce. The palette is significantly more R&B than her debut, with luminaries as disparate as Tyla, Summer Walker, and a sampled Janet Jackson (on the lovely "Principal," which warns "take me anywhere but don't take me for granted") on hand to occasionally coo over softcore like "On My Back" ("I want to hold it when you pee"); even the rare appearance by a young rapper is "sexy drill" purveyor Cash Cobain, who's accustomed to rapping between the sheets. At almost 80 minutes, anyone could whittle AM I THE DRAMA? down to their ideal follow-up (start by chopping Lizzo singing 4 Non Blondes on "What's Goin On"), but don't dare peace out before that seismic "Up" and "WAP" encore. It's Cardi's drama, we just live in it. © Daniel Aaron/Qobuz	39	CD	2026-01-18 21:52:11.829124	2

But in contrast to Charlie Chaplin’s globe in The Dictator, this glittering ball did not explode at the end of the performance. The ex-Disney child star securely remained in place upon this symbol of disco music as if to demonstrate her freedom is indestructible and indissociable from her musical expression. In this song, she stresses that she “belongs to no one” and that she is “born to run”. But while the disco in this lively record is tinted with airs of punk and rock, there are still elements of bubble-gum pop that show that the past Cyrus has not completely disappeared. Prisoner is a perfect example of this with its persistent melody that lightly illustrates a more sophisticated, feminist theme and Cyrus’ assured and slightly gravelly voice. Plastic Rock embodies influences of some pop-rock and feminist icons from the 80s and 90s. The record sleeve’s design features photography from legendary rock photographer Mick Rock and outfits by the stylist Jean-Paul Gaultier – the ultimate proof of Cyrus’ Madonna-esque high-heeled feminist approach. The features and covers on this album follow the theme such as the jumbled duo Black Karma with Joan Jett (known for her cover of I Love Rock’n’Roll in 1982), as well as live covers of the Cranberries (Zombie) and Blondie (Heart of Glass).

Like so many Disney starlets, Cyrus needed to distance herself from her tween pop past; Can't Be Tamed tiptoed toward a more adult persona, but Bangerz kicks down the doors. This is her first non-Disney album, and in many ways it feels like a debut, an R&B and hip-hop-tinged coming-out party that introduces Miley as an A-list pop star. Bangerz's guest list is packed with star producers, including Pharrell Williams and Mike WiLL Made It, and vocalists like Britney Spears, who cameos on the fizzy "SMS (Bangerz)." Cyrus has taken cues from more established pop stars in the past -- Can't Be Tamed often evoked Ke$ha -- but one of the models for this album is clearly Rihanna. Miley's summer 2013 hit "We Can't Stop" was even originally offered to Rihanna, and they share a nasally buzz in their singing and a commitment to partying in their songs (if possible, "Love Money Party" sounds even more like a Rihanna-be than "We Can't Stop"). Bangerz's take on R&B is most convincing when it's balanced with Cyrus' country and pop roots, as on the Pharrell productions "4x4," an improbable but entertaining piece of country-rap featuring Nelly, and "#GETITRIGHT," which is so bouncy it almost sounds innocent despite Miley's insistence that she wants to be naughty. Cyrus and company also spend plenty of time sampling other early-2010s trends, whether it's the wobbly, dubstep-like synths on "Drive" or the EDM-leaning ballad "Someone Else," but on every track, she sounds more mature than ever before. Despite its flashier moments, there are also plenty of ballads, something hinted at by the album's second single, "Wrecking Ball." Bangerz even opens with a slow song (the unabashedly romantic "Adore You"), which in its own way is almost as bold a move as the publicity events that preceded the album's release. Brassy empowerment jams like "Maybe You're Right," "Do My Thang," and "FU" sell Cyrus as an independent woman, and the album accomplishes that mission: Bangerz transforms Miley into a pop star who won't -- and can't -- be ignored as she rings in her twenties.© Heather Phares /TiVo	9	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:52:15.510145	1
776756	Revival	Selena Gomez	128.63	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/82/43/0060254754382_600.jpg	qobuz:27544745|0060254754382	During the short time since her last album, 2013's Stars Dance, and the release of Revival in 2015, Selena Gomez went through about a decade's worth of stuff. A label change (from Hollywood to Interscope), a very public breakup with longtime on-off boyfriend Justin Bieber, management issues, various rehab rumors, and even a few good things (a hit single, a charting collaboration with Zedd). Revival is something of a fresh start for Gomez, both musically and personally. Taking more control over the album, with more writing credits and production oversight, the sound veers away from the bubblegum nature of her early work or the genre-hopping aspects of other releases. Instead, the album sticks pretty close to a club bangers-and-ballads mix with a couple of R&B-inspired jams thrown in. Gomez sounds most at home on the uptempo dance tracks like "Kill 'Em with Kindness" or "Me & the Rhythm," where the smoothness of her voice fits in with the vacant abandon of the beat. She also does a fine job on the tracks that slip outside the bounds of the formula, namely on the snappy, sassy Charli XCX-written "Same Old Love" or the steamy, tricked-out Latin beats and weird synthesizers in "Body Heat." These tracks show at her best, dialing up her personality to match the wit and imagination shown in the arrangements. The songs that don't fare as well are those where Gomez sounds most personal. She aims for several kinds of maturity here, but in the process the music suffers. Whether on the confessional piano ballad "Camouflage," the bruising "Sober" or the cartoonishly sexy "Good for You," it feels forced and overdone. Despite a few too many songs like this, there is still much to like about the album. There are some songs as good as anything she's done and the production is professional all the way thanks to heavy hitters like Stargate, Max Martin, and Hit Boy. It makes for a solid pop album overall, but it's a little too formulaic and predictable to rate among her best work.© Tim Sendra /TiVo	24	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:54:19.631872	1
539013	I Said I Love You First	Selena Gomez	173.55	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/na/o4/bau5v1w10o4na_600.jpg	qobuz:325739226|bau5v1w10o4na	It can be a risky proposition to take your love story public, let alone make it the centerpiece of your art (hello, J. Lo). But Selena Gomez and her producer fiancé Benny Blanco are all in on the singer's fourth album. Despite having only dated for a couple of years, they've been musical accomplices for a decade, and I Said I Love You First charts their relationship from friendship to engagement. Gomez—who has a good history with horn-dog songs ("Bad Liar," "Hands to Myself")—is mostly in a playful mood, particularly on "Sunset Blvd," which seems to draw inspiration from Japanese city pop and is laden with innuendo: "I just wanna touch it, touch it/ Try your hardest not to bust it/ Give me, give me, how I love your big, big … heart." That's immediately followed by "Cowboy," a slow-drift jam that takes things to the next base ("Put your hands on me/ Ride it like a cowboy") and pulls in GloRilla for an explicit outro verse that sounds like a voicenote. Gomez is also not above cutting a new lover's too-friendly friend out of the picture with the buttery, fluttery "Don't Take It Personally." And she reaches into her past to re-examine an old betrayal ("Don't Wanna Cry," a gently turning mirror ball with a sultry beat) and shake off a vivid dream about an ex in "You Said You Were Sorry," which finds her sounding ethereal and even Lana del Rey-esque. In an unusual move, Gomez and Blanco include a collaborative single from 2019, the reggaeton-flavored "I Can't Get Enough" with guest J Balvin and a memorable "mm-mm-mm-mm" hook. It's interesting to hear the six-year-old song again here, as a sort of living testimony to how Gomez's vocal style has been evolving. Long gone is the slightly scratchy style of 2014's giddy fun "Love You Like a Love Song," in favor of the softness she's been moving toward for a while. While her voice can feel a bit thin on the muted, melancholy "Younger and Hotter Than Me" ("We're not getting any younger/ But your girlfriends seem to"), her gauzy curves sound great alongside Gracie Abrams' light, girlish rasp for the caffeinated bop "Call Me When You Break Up." Other guests include María Zardoya of the Marías, matching Gomez sigh for weightless sigh on "Ojos Tristes" (translation: "Sad Eyes"), which borrows heavily from Spanish singer Jeanette's dreamy early '80s hit "El Muchacho de los Ojos Tristes." Charli XCX offers a low-key background assist on jittery "Bluest Flame," and Finneas gets a co-write credit on Billie-ish "Scared of Loving You." Like many other former child stars, Gomez has lived a lot of life in 32 years; I Said I Love You First makes it easy to root for her happiness. © Shelly Ridenour/Qobuz	19	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:54:19.631872	1

In the music video (and on the album cover), the 30-something artist wears a dazzling gown by Thierry Mugler. The two interludes through the album continue to reinforce a sense of a soundtrack to some imagined story. The singer elaborates on this concept: “The visual component of this is driving sound… The songs, whether they’re about destruction or heartbreak or death, they’re presented in a way that is beautiful, because the nastiest times of our lives do have a point of beauty.” Miley even goes beyond the visual references to transcend time: the track “Something Beautiful” immerses us in the soul of the 1970s, while “Walk of Fame” makes nods to 1980s pop, specifically Bronski Beat. Over in the ballad world, Miley contributes two gems: “More To Lose” showcases her unmistakable vocal tone, and “Give Me Love” closes the album with a heartfelt declaration to drummer Maxx Morando, her current boyfriend. © Nicolas Magenham/Qobuz	7	CD	2026-01-18 21:52:27.187014	2
616074	Endless Summer Vacation	Miley Cyrus	313.4	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/4b/b8/xayo8bnjmb84b_600.jpg	qobuz:200804904|xayo8bnjmb84b	It's been a decade since Bangerz positioned Miley Cyrus as a young woman publicly transforming from Disney goof to party girl. In many ways, it was the predictable child-star cry for attention—I can drink alcohol! I can take drugs! I can have sex! I can shave off my long locks and wear underwear as outerwear!—yet the wild and wooly songs were anything but predictable. Now, Cyrus is 30; she's been married and divorced; she's lived through twerking scandals. And her new album lets the world know she's in a new place: Like Madonna, Cyrus is pretty brilliant at stylistic reinvention. It opens with her inescapable, disco-kissed hit "Flowers." An anthem for single women and men, it cleverly serves an empowered response to Bruno Mars' simpering 2013 ballad "When I Was Your Man," with its lyrics about how he should've bought his girl flowers and held her hand and taken her to parties to dance. "I can buy myself flowers," Cyrus declares. "Write my name in the sand … I can take myself dancing/ I can hold my own hand/ Yeah, I can love me better than/ You can." First things first, there is no other song as good as this on the record (or, when it was released, on the radio). But there is plenty to enjoy. With breezy beats that live up to its name, "Island" echoes the theme of "Flowers" like it was the first try of Cyrus getting used to being on her own: "I'm on an island/ Dirty dancing in the sun/ So close to heaven/ But so far from everyone … Am I stranded on an island?/ Or have I landed in paradise?" Dreamy "Rose Colored Lenses"—about wanting to stay in bed with someone rather than let the realities of the outside world ruin what you have—partners a languid melody with '90s alt beats and bouncy bass. "You" is a woozy, soulful slow jam about letting loose: "I wanna drive down to Texas/ flip off my exes/ Get kind of reckless/ and have wild, wild, wild sex under the moon." "Violet Chemistry" reunites Cyrus with Mike WiLL Made-It (who produced Bangerz' excellent, sedative-laced "We Can't Stop"); it's pretty and ready for moving around mindlessly on the dance floor, but has none of the eccentricity of their past collaborations. "Thousand Miles," too, is a wasted opportunity. Folksy Americana with a little Latin flair, it features harmonies from Brandi Carlile in songbird mode. But what a treat it would be to hear these two powerhouses go at it in a real duet. Sia guests on the stomping "Muddy Feet," a "take this love and shove it" number that echoes Justin Timberlake's "Cry Me a River." You can imagine Lady Gaga or even Bonnie Tyler recording "Wonder Woman," but Cyrus absolutely owns the piano ballad. And the closer, a demo of "Flowers" with just her and an electric piano, is chill-inducing. © Shelly Ridenour/Qobuz	18	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:52:27.187018	1
483692	Endless Summer Vacation	Miley Cyrus	299.43	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/rc/55/eybbs40lv55rc_600.jpg	qobuz:225790035|eybbs40lv55rc	Miley Cyrus has made a career out of doing whatever she wants, and on Endless Summer Vacation, it's growing up and moving on. Framed by the concept of a day and night in Los Angeles, this is a mature album in the best sense of the word; like a good relationship, it's smooth, but not dull, grounded in resilience and self-love. Cyrus attempted a similar mindset on Younger Now, but this time it feels more genuine. She's grown into this mood, starting with her voice, which imbues these songs with significant emotional depth. Nowhere is this more apparent than on the album's opening track and massive hit single, "Flowers." Over a poised fusion of vintage soft rock, disco, and 2020s pop, Cyrus' richly raspy delivery carries the pain, healing, and strength of forgiving a former lover while acknowledging that being alone is better. It's one of her finest moments, with a low-key confidence that feels truer because she's not shouting -- she's worlds away from the devastation of "Wrecking Ball." Starting Endless Summer Vacation with "Flowers" shows how much her artistry has developed even since Plastic Hearts. There's more genuine sweetness in Cyrus' music than in some time, particularly on "Rose Colored Lenses," which spins a swooning fantasy of a perfect day, complete with bubbly saxophones and harpsichord flourishes. She's grown into a remarkably candid songwriter, able to capture a relationship's power dynamic in a single line on "Wildcard" ("Go and meet your mom/In a dress too tight"), while finding the sweet spot between independence and self-destruction. Though Endless Summer Vacation has fewer collaborations than Plastic Hearts, they're just as well chosen. Brandi Carlile's silky harmonies are the perfect backdrop for Cyrus' twangy wanderlust meditations on "Thousand Miles," and Sia adds extra firepower to "Muddy Feet"'s gospel-inflected takedown of a cheater. While Endless Summer Vacation's first half is so consistent that it's tempting to want to spend more time with the witty, self-aware Miley it presents, the album's later songs prove she's not playing it too safe. She could probably spend her entire career singing songs like the piano ballad "Wonder Woman" or "You," a torchy slow dance for slightly reformed hedonists, but Vacation is all the richer thanks to curveballs like the country-meets-dance-pop of "River" or "Handstand," a piece of fever-dream synth pop that proves the instinct that sparked Miley Cyrus and Her Dead Petz is still within her. Cyrus will probably never settle on just one or two sounds to express herself, but her voice and vision are strong enough on Endless Summer Vacation to suggest she'll never need to.© Heather Phares /TiVo	7	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:52:27.187018	1

817538	Younger Now	Miley Cyrus	228.31	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/01/56/0886446685601_600.jpg	qobuz:43560677|0886446685601	Younger Now is a bit of a sly nod to a public who watched Miley Cyrus explore a defiantly loud post-adolescence: she may be older, but she's not necessarily grown up. The joke is, Younger Now is most certainly an album that announces Miley's mature phase, a record that shakes off the druggy haze of Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz -- an album cut at the height of her infatuation with the Flaming Lips -- yet retains the services of Oren Yoel, a producer/songwriter who collaborated with her on that 2015 digital-only effort. That's the first sign that Younger Now may not be the back-to-the-roots move its retro-iconography and Dolly Parton duet may suggest. Certainly, there are country-ish songs scattered throughout the album -- a hoedown and a waltz, but mostly ballads -- but they're delivered with an arched eyebrow, a distancing effect accentuated by how the album unfurls with a pair of songs where Cyrus brightens up the Californian melancholy of Lana Del Rey. Despite a showstopping performance or two, the kind of pyrotechnics that sound ripped from the heart, sadness isn't Miley's thing. Her specialty is good times, either raving until the early dawn or chilling out on the beach...or maybe whiling away the hours online. Without ever succumbing to the garish neon extremes of Bangerz or the hangover ache of Dead Petz, Younger Now touches upon each of these obsessions and then wraps them in a tidy package. Occasionally, this slick veneer can masquerade the Internet irony of an individual song -- "Week Without You" plays like a Grease parody, the Dolly duet "Rainbowland" suggests a theme park of dancing GIFs -- but the professionalism of both the production and the performance highlights Cyrus' savvy skills. Younger Now reveals she's as comfortable crafting a plaintive country ballad ("Miss You So Much") as effervescent disco ("Thinkin'"), and the fact that these two seemingly disparate styles sit next to each other not altogether comfortably speaks to how Miley Cyrus' aesthetic is thoroughly modern. She may not bother with EDM drops or murmured vocals -- she's justifiably proud of flaunting her voice -- but she perceives no line dividing the past and the present, eagerly dressing up old-fashioned forms in newfangled sounds. If Younger Now seems slightly scattered as it flits from song to song, it nevertheless adds up to a portrait of a pop star so confident of her swagger, she doesn't bother with such niceties as old-fashioned flow. She knows she's got style for miles and miles, enough to keep her afloat when the time comes that she delivers her country tunes with acoustic guitars, not digital instruments, and she has the wisdom to know that snappy sheen is precisely what this particular album needs.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	27	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:52:27.187019	1

The Time of Our Lives still boasts a couple of frothy, Hannah-esque party anthems, the title track and "Party in the USA." Though Cyrus' voice borders on shrill on both songs, they'll please Montana fans (that goes double for the live version of "Before the Storm" with the Jonas Brothers). However, when she lets her inner rock chick and ballad-singing diva come to the fore, Cyrus really shines: the lead track "Kicking and Screaming" has more guts and swagger than anything else she has recorded, and "Talk Is Cheap" underscores that she has a real flair for rock -- albeit of the well-groomed, Disney-fied variety. She is just as accomplished on the EP's ballads, particularly "Obsessed." Cyrus has always sounded older than her years, and as she leaves her teens, that's a good thing -- especially since The Time of Our Lives shows her music is catching up to her pipes.© Heather Phares /TiVo	33	CD	2026-01-18 21:52:27.18702	2

On Can’t Be Tamed’s cover, she’s clad in black from her heavily lined eyes to the tips of her toes, sporting pale skin and chestnut hair several shades darker than Hannah Montana blonde. The album’s sound is several shades darker too, but within reason; while none of these songs sounds like it belongs on one of her alter ego’s albums, Can’t Be Tamed was released by Hollywood Records, Disney’s more mature imprint. So while “Liberty Walk”'s bold synths and beats and rapped verses sound edgier than any of Cyrus' previous work, upbeat lyrics like “Don’t live a lie/This is your life” keep the song Radio Disney-friendly. She also tries this dancefloor-ready sound out for size on “Who Owns My Heart,” the stomping title track, and “Permanent December,” which apes the Auto-Tuned rapping of Kesha's “Tik Tok” minus that song’s mindless fun, which is actually a recurring problem on Can’t Be Tamed: too often, Cyrus equates grown-up with joyless, and songs like “Scars” reach for an emotional depth that isn’t there. Though pop was Cyrus' bread and butter during her Hannah years, the album’s synth-dominated tunes don’t jell with her voice; she sounds more natural and more grown-up on the songs that straddle rock and country, including the revved-up cover of Poison's “Every Rose Has Its Thorn” and the anthemic “Two More Lonely People,” which makes the most of her voice and appeal as they are. Even occasionally overwrought ballads like “Stay” and “Take Me Along” are a more organic fit for the singer she has been and could become. At times Can’t Be Tamed feels perfunctory, doing the job of showing Cyrus is growing up without making her too mature for her still-young fan base and little else. She’s taken another step away from Hannah here, but there should be room for fun even in more adult musical territory.© Heather Phares /TiVo	14	CD	2026-01-18 21:52:27.187021	2
298992	Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz	Miley Cyrus	47.02	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/28/51/0886445615128_600.jpg	qobuz:39905233|0886445615128	Ever since her Hannah Montana days, when she balanced Disney pop with rootsier songs, Miley Cyrus has proven that she's versatile. Though she spent years distancing herself from those beginnings, her eclectic approach continued as she flirted with more mature versions of pop, dance, and hip-hop. While her previous transitions were seamless, she revels in warts-and-all indulgence on Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz. A whopping 92 minutes long, Cyrus' fifth full-length is a space pop album, a dance album, and a tripped-out singer/songwriter album -- and its best moments are among the most genuine music she's made. She sounds as brash and earnest as the people her age who, because they're not world-famous pop stars, head off to college and expand their horizons, musical and otherwise. Since Cyrus is a world-famous pop star, her horizon-expanding includes collaborations with the Flaming Lips, Ariel Pink, and Phantogram's Sarah Barthel. Lips fans know that the band will collaborate with just about anyone, but their involvement in Dead Petz doesn't feel like a stunt. Hearing their lush oddities combined with her vocal chops makes for some of the brightest highlights: "The Floyd Song (Sunrise)" boasts more of the band's signature euphoria than much of their 2010s output, while "Evil Is But a Shadow"'s gloomy introspection sounds even eerier with Cyrus singing it. Here and throughout Dead Petz, it's all about the contrasts. Cyrus opens the album with "Dooo It!," one of the most aggressive tracks here, and follows it with one of the sweetest, "Karen Don't Be Sad." Later, she spans the frank sexuality of "Bang Me Box" and the jokey sentimentality of "Pablow the Blowfish," a tale of love and sushi gone wrong. Later on, Cyrus revisits some of Bangerz's sounds and collaborators: with a few tweaks, "Lighter" and "Fweaky" (both produced by Mike WiLL Made It) could get airplay on Top 40 radio; meanwhile, the hazy Big Sean reunion "Tangerine" and bittersweet Oren Yoel production "Space Boots" have a very different kind of party vibe than Cyrus' previous album. Dead Petz's sprawl also finds her moving into synth pop territory more convincingly than might be expected, whether she's duetting with Barthel on the standout "Slab of Butter (Scorpion)" or emphasizing her raspy, Stevie Nicks-like drawl on the driving "1 Sun." At times, the album is as annoying as feared, peppered with ramblings that must have been a blast to make but aren't necessarily as much fun for the audience, such as the self-explanatory "I'm So Drunk." Songs like this reflect how the album wears its faults on its sleeve: it's too long and Cyrus sometimes tries too hard, but she uses the freedom this kind of guerrilla release affords to the hilt: freedom to be vulnerable, freedom to be sexual, freedom to make mistakes. Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz needs an editor, but there's more than enough worthwhile music here to transcend shock value.© Heather Phares /TiVo	22	CD	2026-01-18 21:52:27.187022	2

It's like hearing Dolly Parton sigh, "Am I really doing this?"  before putting on her bra and wig. Carpenter—who Parton has said "looks like she could be my little sister"—is back with her thoroughly modern pin-up act, and she's turned the cheeky pop-tart self-awareness up to 11. "I get wet at the thought of you/ Uh-huh!/ Being a responsible guy/ Treating me like you're supposed to do/ Tears run down my thighs," she sings on "Tears," a spinning, twirling disco turn that takes her bawdy suggestiveness to new levels of blue. Carpenter grins, but never blushes, as she offers her date the "House Tour"—the house being her body. "I just want you to come inside," she sings, "but never enter through the backdoor … Yeah I spent a little fortune on the waxed floors/ We can be a little reckless 'cause it's insured." The song's electro-funk flourishes recall Vanity 6 and Apollonia 6, and you've gotta wonder if Prince would have loved Carpenter. She's smart enough to choose collaborators who get the joke. Carpenter once again works with songwriter Amy Allen and producers John Ryan and Jack Antonoff, and they match her songs with the whole-package humor required. Recorded with Antonoff, "Manchild" plays out as light country with baroque Vegas glitz: cheesy '80s synth, horse-gallop rhythm, cartoonishly twanged-out guitar solos. "Amen," Carpenter sings; "Hey, men!" an exuberant girl-gang responds as she giggles. The lively chorus of "Go Go Juice"—about getting her heart broken, getting drunk and getting on the phone with wine goggles—is a boot-scoot away from being a Kelsea Ballerini song. "Never Getting Laid" is chilled R&B pop with shades of '90s quiet storm—Gen Z adult contemporary, and Carpenter wishes an ex a lifetime of agoraphobia and sexlessness. (She knows what a curse that is. "My Man on Willpower," which feels like a cousin to the great 2024 single "Please Please Please," finds her lamenting how her work-obsessed dude "won't touch me with a 20 foot pole.") The other spiritual ancestor here is ABBA, as Carpenter traffics in the Swedes' glorious melodrama on both sunny-sounding "Nobody's Son" and horn-blasting "Goodbye." Carpenter has said Man's Best Friend "wasn't written from a place of 'How do I one-up myself?'" after the wild success of Short n' Sweet. Cover to cover, it's a stronger record with fewer skips. But you have to wonder how long she can keep up the comedy. Even here, when she turns sincere on "We Almost Broke Up Again Last Night" and "Sugar Talking"—two good songs that show off her singing chops—it's hard to take her seriously. © Shelly Ridenour/Qobuz	31	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:52:30.465964	1

But the follow-up has her blooming into a full-grown femme fatale. A bleach blonde, old-school pin-up with a wicked sense of humor, she is every bit still an actress: at once playing a "little old me" maneater and America's meta-modern sweetheart. On summer-of-'24's inescapable "Please Please Please," she starts off as a helpless damsel, hitting the featheriest of high notes to implore a beau not to betray her ("Don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice"). But then she reaches down, ever so briefly, to a low growl—"I beg you don't embarrass me, motherfucker"—before turning right back on a dime. Who's the one flirting with danger here? The Jack Antonoff-produced song is catchy as anything, cheesy but delectable, burbling synth on ice. "Espresso," an insidiously hooky song that evokes Doja Cat's "Say So" era, comes on like one big fake-eyelash wink as Carpenter basks in her confidence with loopy poetry. She coos "Say you can't sleep, baby, I know/ That's that me espresso" and "I Mountain Dew it for ya" shamelessly, but also mutters "stupid," almost snorting, and you can practically hear the eye roll. "Good Graces" finds Carpenter delivering threats with a butter-wouldn't-melt smile ("I'll tell the world you finish your chores prematurely/ Break my heart and I swear I'm moving on with your favorite athlete") to chill, lite R&B, tra-la-la repeating "I won't give a fuck about you." Doe-eyed folk bleeds into a skittering synth-pop beat on "Sharpest Tool" as she dismisses a guy she had sex with as "not the sharpest tool in the shed" after he went and "found god" with an ex. She's got a sad boi's number on "Dumb & Poetic" (rolling her eyes again at guys who "jack off to lyrics by Leonard Cohen"), a soft-boil bit of café folk. But she also can't resist these himbos. Borrowing from '80s Japanese city-pop—laced with an impishly knowing guitar solo—fun "Juno" finds Carpenter so "fuckin' horny" she just might be willing to get knocked up (like the teen-pregnancy comedic movie of the same name). Flipping the script, "Taste" addresses her ex's new girl, promising that the singer made such a lasting impression you can still taste her on his lips—and everywhere else. Carpenter delights in the lewdness, all breathy sighs and mischievous giggles as she describes how "He pins you down in the carpet/ makes paintings with his tongue" but "every time you close your eyes/ And feel his lips, you're feelin' mine." There's also "Slim Pickins"—cowgirl cosplay, complete with banjo—that finds her lamenting the curse of being attracted to men: "And since the Lord forgot my gay awakening." Immediately after the album's release, that line got a lot of attention online; and isn't that really the point? As Carpenter reminds us, again and again, she's in on the joke. © Shelly Ridenour/Qobuz	9	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:52:30.465967	1

Having started out as a Disney kid in the 2010s, Carpenter had already transcended her early years by the time she released 2022's Emails I Can't Send, an album that found her fusing a personal singer/songwriter style with warm pop and dance hooks. Short n' Sweet takes her transformation even further, essentially starting fresh with a more potent and sophisticated sound, one that perfectly captures her cherubically resonant vocals and cheeky, eye-winking confidence. It doesn't hurt that she's teamed with two of the most empathetic pop producers in Jack Antonoff and Julian Bunetta. Also on board as co-writers and producers are John Ryan, Ian Kirkpatrick, and Amy Allen. This is a good team for Carpenter, who makes the most of her collaborations, moving between sultry, '70s-inspired disco and soul (via Bunetta) and breezy, '80s-inspired pop/rock (via Antonoff). There's the sparkling pop/rock opener, "Taste," which sounds improbably as if Tom Petty had written a song for Madonna in the '80s. We also get the romantic "Please Please Please," with its Electric Light Orchestra synths and multi-tracked Fleetwood Mac harmonies. Elsewhere, Carpenter deftly responds to the cotton-soft pop and R&B vibes of her contemporaries Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift on cuts like "Good Graces," "Sharpest Tool," and "Bed Chem" -- tracks that are truly low-key bangers that get stuck in your head. What's so great about her work here is how effortless and genuine the album sounds. Carpenter is a co-writer on every track, and there's a sharpness and gentle wit to the lyrics throughout. On "Taste," she revels the lasting impression she has surely made on her ex and by proxy his new paramour, coyly singing, "You're wonderin' why half his clothes went missin'/My body's where they're at/Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'/Next to me, one degree of separation." Even on the break-out summer hit "Espresso," with its flirty Euro-dance-club-meets-new-jack-swing vibe, Carpenter oozes a cool, knowing sensuality, ably owning the deliciously cheeky "me oh, my oh, that's me espresso" rhyme scheme. The song, which at first seems to be aiming for a fun, lightweight take on Earth, Wind & Fire, quickly reveals itself as one of those indispensable summer anthems that, as with all of Short n' Sweet, is sure to bubble back up every year.© Matt Collar /TiVo	34	CD	2026-01-18 21:52:43.063686	2

Her first full-length release since moving to Island Records, the record builds nicely upon the upbeat dance-pop of her early work while also displaying her growing strength and honesty as a songwriter. It also finds her drawing inspiration from the classic singer/songwriter style of artists like Carly Simon and Carole King while fitting well alongside the contemporary work of artists like Conan Gray. Much of the album is loosely conceptualized around emails she wrote to herself. For example, the title track, "Emails I Can't Send," is a yearning piano ballad in which a daughter excoriates her father for his infidelity to her mother. Similarly, "Vicious" is a hooky, acoustic guitar-driven anthem in which Carpenter addresses her quiet anguish over a particularly toxic relationship. More upbeat is "Read Your Mind," in which she ruminates on a wishy-washy lover on a hooky track that evokes the sparkling disco-pop of the Cardigans. With Emails I Can't Send, Carpenter has crafted a record that reflects her emotional maturity five albums into her career, which also feels like a refreshing new start.© Matt Collar /TiVo	12	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:52:43.063687	1

570134	Short n' Sweet	Sabrina Carpenter	61.87	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/hb/bz/hox2m3tslbzhb_600.jpg	qobuz:285277508|hox2m3tslbzhb	With 2024's Short n' Sweet, Sabrina Carpenter reintroduces herself on an instant classic summer album of stylishly fun, smartly-executed pop. Having started out as a Disney kid in the 2010's, Carpenter had already transcended her early years by the time she released 2022's Emails I Can't Send, an album that found her fusing a personal, singer/songwriter style with warm pop and dance hooks. Yet, Short n' Sweet takes her transformation even further, essentially starting fresh with a more potent and sophisticated sound, one that perfectly captures her cherubically resonant vocals and cheeky, eye-winking confidence. It doesn't hurt that she's teamed with two of the most empathetic pop producers in Jack Antonoff and Julian Bunetta. Also on board as co-writers and producers are John Ryan, Ian Kirkpatrick, and Amy Allen. This is a good team for Carpenter who makes the most of her collaborations, moving between sultry, '70s-inspired disco and soul (via Bunetta) and breezy, '80s-inspired pop/rock (via Antonoff). There's the sparkling pop/rock opener "Taste," which sounds improbably as if Tom Petty had written a song for Madonna in the '80s. We also get the romantic "Please Please Please," with its Electric Light Orchestra synths and multi-tracked Fleetwood Mac harmonies. Elsewhere, Carpenter deftly responds to the cotton-soft pop and R&B vibes of her contemporaries Ariana Grande and Taylor Swift on cuts like "Good Graces," "Sharpest Tool" and "Bad Chem;" ostensible album tracks that are truly lowkey bangers that get stuck in your head. What's so great about her work here is how effortless and genuine the album sounds. Carpenter is a co-writer on every track and there's a sharpness and gentle wit to the lyrics throughout. On "Taste," she revels the lasting impression she has surely made on her ex and by proxy his new paramore, coyly singing, "You're wonderin' why half his clothes went missin'/My body's where they're at/Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'/Next to me, one degree of separation." Even on the break-out summer hit "Espresso" with its flirty euro dance club-meets-new-jack-swing-vibe, Carpenter oozes a cool, knowing sensuality, ably owning the deliciously cheeky "me oh, my oh, that's me espresso" rhyme scheme. The song, which at first seems to be aiming for a fun, lightweight take on Earth, Wind & Fire, quickly reveals itself as one of those indispensable summer anthems that, as with all of Short n' Sweet, is sure to bubble back up every year.© Matt Collar /TiVo	8	CD	2026-01-18 21:52:43.063691	2

The star of Disney Channel's Girl Meets World, Carpenter's cherubic visage and bright vocals are already well known to the many fans of her show.

939970	Rare	Selena Gomez	89.51	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/rc/jg/tf6n5jaoijgrc_600.jpg	qobuz:84559329|tf6n5jaoijgrc	The big news for Selena Gomez before the release of her sixth album, Rare, is that she finally had a number one single after years of getting close. The introspective and emotionally raw ballad "Lose You to Love Me" surrounded Gomez's aching vocals with sparse piano, swirling strings, and lush background vocals, and connected instantly with her fans and anyone who ever had to ditch someone in order to save themselves. That song, and the record it appears on, mark something of a turning point in her career. Where in the past she focused mostly on breezy sentiments, playful frothy pop, and more recently sexy come-ons, now she's digging deeper and mining her own life and loves for subject matter in more obvious and revealing ways. It may not be totally confessional -- and each song is helped to the finish line by teams of professional songwriters -- but within the realm of mainstream modern pop, Rare is surprisingly honest lyrically and Gomez sounds more open and invested in the songs than ever before. Lyrically they range from stripped bare ("Lose You," "Vulnerable") to empowered (the title track, "Look at Her Now") with stops along the way at freedom (the sparkly, French disco-inspired "Dance Again"), realization ("Kinda Crazy"), and slyly moving on ("Fun"). The team pair the words with hooky choruses that are easy to imagine being sung along with really loud and some sure-handed production that's never boring and strays happily into odd territory now and again -- the junky drum sound on "Rare," "Look at Her Now"'s chopped-up vocals, the computer-tweaked vocals of "People You Know," and the wobbly synths and arrangements of "A Sweeter Place" crafted by Kid Cudi. Gomez's albums work best when they don't chase trends, or do obvious things, and there is precious little of that here; only the very "Havana"-esque "Ring" falls victim to that particular problem. It's highly unlikely that Gomez will ever venture to the cutting edge of pop, but Rare proves that when she has strong songs and the producers get a little weird, she's just enough outside the mainstream to sound fresh. Add in some deeply felt and real emotion like she does here, and it verges on being something special, maybe her best record yet. If it isn't that, it's at least her most interesting one yet, and that's something fans of the homogenized pop scene of the era should celebrate.© Tim Sendra /TiVo	9	CD	2026-01-18 21:54:31.515412	2
221259	When The Sun Goes Down	Selena Gomez	145.93	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/73/41/0005008724173_600.jpg	qobuz:3639423|0005008724173	You’d be forgiven if you thought Selena Gomez & the Scene’s third album in three years, 2011's When the Sun Goes Down, might show signs of a dip in quality control due to cranking out albums so quickly. You’d be wrong, though, because When the Sun Goes Down is actually an improvement over 2010's Year Without Rain. Where that record tried to position Gomez as a more serious and adult artist with varying levels of success, here she’s back to mostly being a young and breezy, happy-go-lucky pop singer. With a couple exceptions, the songs are sassier, lighter, and more fun. Her vocals are more spirited, the arrangements less reliant on heavy synths, and overall, there’s a more playful feeling to the record that’s more in keeping with her first album. She bubbles her way through dancefloor-friendly tracks like “Bang Bang Bang” and “That’s More Like It,” smolders a little (on her duet with Pixie Lott “We Own the Night” and "Middle of Nowhere"), and comes on like a convincing disco diva on “Hit the Lights.” The only stumble is the overly earnest empowerment anthem “Who Says,” which comes off a little stiff and out of place. It’s a tiny speck of a flaw though; the rest is really solid and fun modern pop with sharp hooks and a couple surprises, namely the stomping jam “Whiplash,” which channels Goldfrapp’s electro glam and throws in a charmingly odd spoken word section that for some reason is done with a British-y accent. It adds some welcome weirdness to an otherwise straightforward record, and shows how easily and successfully she can slip into different personas and styles. Perhaps a bit too easily, as ultimately, Gomez has yet to stake out an identify all her own: a point driven home in the album’s booklet, which features Gomez in a series of images of her in different guises, from Ann-Margret-style sex kitten to 1930s film star. She seems to be acting out the songs, more than actually feeling the emotions she’s singing about. Which is perfectly fine for disposable pop albums, but if she wants to make a real impact, she’ll need to dig a little deeper or stake out her own territory. That’s for the future, though. For now, as long as she makes records as good and as much fun as When the Sun Goes Down, everything will be fine.© Tim Sendra /TiVo	26	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:54:31.515418	1

Her climb to the top includes bizarre factoids like she once lived in the house where the Eagles recorded Hotel California, plus she once vomited in Paris Hilton’s closet. Working on Hilton's album was the reason she was at the house, so it’s hard not to appreciate how Animal makes Ke$ha sound nothing like an industry vet who used to write for the Veronicas. Here, she’s a gum-snapping, alcohol-abusing Facebook jockey straight out of the suburbs who spits sophomoric but fun putdowns, come-ons, and sig files all over electro beats. Opening with “Maybe I need some rehab/Or maybe just need some sleep,” Animal is upfront about its unwillingness to face the real world, and prefers a garbage chic reality with a liberal shot of the ‘80s. “Party at a Rich Dude’s House” could have fallen off the Fast Times at Ridgemont High soundtrack, while the word “gross” makes a serious comeback throughout the album. The music is heavy on gimmicks -- Auto-Tune, vocoders, and silly samples are all here in abundance -- while able folks like Dr. Luke plus Mim and Liv Nervo are in charge of the colorful electro-pop productions. As far as subversion goes, “Boots and Boys” presents the lusty, “Suicide Blond”-type track from a rare female point of view, but a couple of unexpected and completely unsatisfying ballads are the type of fluff anyone with an edge would avoid. Snooty taste makers and parents should avoid Animal at all costs, but with so many fun, “TiK ToK”-type tracks, the album has plenty for both brats and the bratty at heart.© David Jeffries /TiVo	7	CD	2026-01-18 21:52:45.911239	2

(Period) seeks to answer, after a decade of high-profile lawsuit battles that resulted in the singer and her longtime (former) producer Dr. Luke settling their messy litigation in 2024. Her last album, which was also her final entry released via Dr. Luke’s imprint, found the party girl toning everything down and trying out folk, gospel, country and acoustic elements. But Period is a whiplash back to Kesha 1.0. "You want kids/ Well, I am mother," she sings on "JOYRIDE.," reminding us all that she is the original brat, years before Charli XCX (who paid homage by featuring Kesha on her "Spring breakers" remix). But their connection, at least as it manifests here, is more spiritual than sonic. Produced by Charli collaborator Zhone, "JOYRIDE." is trying hard to be a lot—a magpie’s nest of honking accordion and swooping synth, heavy sighs and a horror-camp singing style. It’s sweaty, glow-stick EDM x fun-house polka that follows a familiar Kesha lyrical formula: blasé boredom ("This party sucks/ I’m 'bout to ditch") alternated with the constant quest for hedonism ("I’m just looking for a/ Good time tonight"). "Boys are my cocaine/ Bikers and the dumb bros, daddies and the gym hoes," she declares over the racing hyperpop rhythm of "BOY CRAZY.," her voice tweaked to sound like a femmebot.  "YIPPEE-KI-YAY.," a "good goddamn yeehaw" produced with Nova Wav (the duo with multiple credits on Beyoncé's Renaissance), jumps on the Shaboozey "A Bar Song (Tipsy)" trend but amps up the clap-and-stomp rhythm to a boom. Kiss-off "DELUSIONAL." ("Now you're just another song on my setlist/ Now you're just another charm on this necklace") is built on layers and layers of booming bass, slamming door beats, loops and heavy effects—but also fluttery synth that suggests, if you stripped clean all the whiz bang, there might be a pretty song underneath … and then, miracle of miracles, all that artifice falls away for a minute and it’s true. And you’re reminded that Kesha can really sing, not just with walloping power or that one-too-many slur she’s perfected. "THE ONE." is clearly Kesha's liberation anthem, a modern-day "Roar" that’s already been used in an empowering espnW ad. Laden with majestic Rocky theme-style horns, a popsicle-melt chant and bass reverberation—as well as a breakdown with bird song—it features our boy-crazy heroine finding true love: "I'm the one I run to/ The one that I chase/ I am the savior and I am the saved." © Shelly Ridenour/Qobuz	10	CD	2026-01-18 21:52:45.911242	2
936980	Rainbow	Kesha	167.73	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/aa/dq/ba4h2x03jdqaa_600.jpg	qobuz:46858550|ba4h2x03jdqaa	A rainbow is a beautiful trick of the light that arises after a thunderstorm, a fact that is not lost on Kesha, who experienced more than her share of tumult after her second album, 2012's Warrior. Two years after its release, the singer/songwriter filed a lawsuit against her producer and collaborator Dr. Luke, alleging emotional and sexual abuse, and he returned the volley with countersuits. Kesha's career crawled to a halt during the ensuing legal battles, and while they had not been resolved by the time she released Rainbow in August of 2017, the involved parties reached a détente to allow the album's appearance. Given how all her problems were laid bare in public, it's no surprise that Kesha opens Rainbow by singing "Don't let the bastards get you down/Don't let the a******* wear you out," a none-too-subtle allusion to her trials and tribulations. It's a theme that she returns to throughout Rainbow, framing it as a lament, an anthem of defiance and ultimately inspiration. As she sings on "Learn to Let Go" -- a song whose title is key to the whole record -- "the past can't haunt me if I don't let it," and if that lyric smacks of self-help, it's also true Kesha doesn't seem haunted by days gone by on Rainbow. Even when she's hinting at her pain, she's not wallowing in it: the whole point of the album is that she's found a path toward peace. Kesha's newfound serenity is underscored by how she still finds plenty of space to cut loose on Rainbow, cranking out a pair of metallic glam-rockers with Eagles of Death Metal, pouring glitter on Johnny Cash ("Hunt You Down"), pushing the neon pulse of "Boots," and even indulging in a bit of twee folk on "Godzilla." Still, the heart of Rainbow lies in its stirring ballads, and while these odes to self-empowerment are endemic to 2010s pop, Kesha's emotions feel earned not because we know her backstory but because her songs are specific, not generic. Sometimes she'll slide into cliché, usually by recycling therapy-speak, but how she pairs these credos with veiled confessions is as striking and moving as her party songs are weird and funny. By slyly alternating between these two extremes throughout Rainbow, Kesha winds up with a comeback that's fully realized emotionally and musically.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	29	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:52:57.910514	1

Cannibal is expressly designed to rectify that situation, amplifying every annoying element of Kesha’s persona -- the sing-song hooks, the relentless Dr. Luke loops, the squeaked sleazy rhymes, the defiantly transparent Auto-Tune slathered on every track, the cheerful bragging about the dingy film left behind after hookups with douche bags. Despite a tacked-on, unnecessary remix of “Animal,” there is no slowing of momentum on Cannibal, no time spent on meaningless self-reflection, it’s just relentless, pulsating trash, its unapologetic vulgarity chipping away at your better impulses. Kesha is either smart or shameless enough -- ultimately the difference doesn’t really matter, not with music designed to appeal to your worst instincts -- to realize her calling card is her unrepentant filthiness, so she taunts that she’ll “C U Next Tuesday,” teases that this place is about to “Blow,” raves that “the beat so fat gonna make me come” on the apropos “Sleazy,” then far eclipses Katy Perry's malicious “Ur so Gay” on the nasty “Grow a Pear.” Sure, Max Martin's hooks, and especially Dr. Luke's neon-colored throb push these tunes into your head -- they’re in top form, aided by the tight focus of an eight-track EP, Cannibal’s brevity trumping the scattershot Animal -- but what makes them stick is Kesha, a pop star lacking pop star looks and a pop star voice. She’s all ravenous id, spitting at strangers and backstabbing friends, humiliating hotties, and laughing at the wreckage in her wake. She is who she is and she offers no apologies.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	20	CD	2026-01-18 21:52:57.910518	2

She could've tried a respectable street, sticking a pen in her heart so her feelings would pour onto the page, or she could have not changed a note, replicating the glitter-bomb of Animal. Cannily, she decided to split the difference between these two routes, remaining defiant in her tastelessness but flashing just enough depth to show she's not a passing fad. Of course, Ke$ha is savvy, knowing which trends to exploit and which to abandon, never compromising her position of the queen of the white-trash outcasts. Her gleeful embrace of low-rent taste separates her from her peers, every one of them containing some sort of aspiration of high-thread-count sophistication, something the ever-calculating pop star could possibly care less about. Throughout Warrior, Ke$ha raises a glass to the classless masses, the girls who only live for good times, never thinking about the consequences of their actions. She's smart enough to know there's a morning after, but unlike Lady Gaga, who happily embraced her status of queen of the Little Monsters, Ke$ha wants to get into the thick of it, writing rallying cries, not anthems. She may be writing songs for her burgeoning cult, but there is no separation from her audience, she is part of them, leading them into battle wearing ripped tights, heavy mascara, and piles of hair. Taste never enters into Ke$ha's equation: she's gleefully vulgar, embracing the magic in a dude's pants, copping a rapper's growl, tossing out profanity, encouraging the shock and awe of any listener with a lick of sense. Ke$ha may play dumb but she isn't stupid: she knows a good hook, whether it's in the rhythm, chorus, lyric, or melody, she knows how far to take it to the edge, knows how to be tacky without being gross. At her best, she is deliriously trashy: she ropes Iggy Pop in for a duet on the filthy "Dirty Love," "C'Mon" surges on the intoxication of a one-night stand, "Only Wanna Dance with You" is a riotous piss-take on the Strokes that pushes them toward the bubblegum where they belong, and on the deluxe edition, she writes the greatest Joan Jett song ever in "Gold Trans Am." Her stabs at sincerity, so casual they could almost be dismissed, benefit by her light touch, particularly the neo-country crawl "Wonderland." Moments like this reveal the precision in her pop machine, but Warrior works because Ke$ha never seems to be trying too hard yet she isn't coasting: she's created a statement of purpose where the highs aren't as high as those on Animal -- nothing digs in like "Tik Tok" or "Take It Off" -- but there are no lows. It's a wall-to-wall party for the freaks, burnouts, outcasts, and misfits and if you don't get it that's your fault, not hers.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	29	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:52:57.910519	1

Those lawsuits prevented her from speaking directly about the events at the root of her personal trauma, so she winds up writing around the problem on the album, focusing on the emotional aftermath instead of the instigating events. Given the anger and sadness roiling in her psyche -- feelings only intensified during the isolation of COVID-19, a pandemic that hit just weeks after she delivered High Road in 2020 -- it's not surprising that Gag Order is a twisted ball of fury and sorrow. Her inner turmoil is conveyed through washes of electronics, contorted Auto-Tunes, spectral samples, and a keening performance from Kesha, whose passion cuts against the dour atmosphere. That's by design: the amorphous swirl captures torment, the singing suggests perseverance. These are the qualities that sustain Gag Order, carrying it through 13 tracks so tightly intertwined it's difficult to tell where one begins or ends; it's as much a complete body of work as Paul Simon's concurrently released Seven Psalms. All that torment and atmosphere amounts to a journey lacking such expected signifiers as hooks or even melody. Gag Order discards these pop niceties because it's designed as a purge, one that delivers catharsis for the artist without much consideration for the audience.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	17	CD	2026-01-18 21:52:57.91052	2

Many are lucky enough to have a hit album, much less two or three. What usually takes a one-hit wonder from the singles charts to career diva lies less in catchy hooks than in a combination of talent and the choice of collaborators. Obviously, the master of this technique is Madonna, whose talent and eye for talent in others has made her not only a worldwide pop sensation, but a worldwide icon. Arguably, running a close second is Kylie Minogue. Starting off as not much more than a female voice for the massively successful Stock, Aitken & Waterman hit factory, she moved on to work with some of the most prominent dance producers of the early '90s, making her one of the most visible pop stars outside of the United States. By 1997, she moved on to working with writers outside the genre. While this may have translated into poor record sales, her motives were in the right place. With 2001's Fever, Minogue combines the disco-diva comeback of the previous year's Light Years with the trend of simple dance rhythms which was prevalent in the teen dance-pop craze of the years surrounding the album's release. While on the surface that might seem like an old dog trying to learn new tricks, Minogue pulls it off with surprising ease. The first single, "Cant Get You Out of My Head," is a sparse, mid-tempo dance number that pulses and grooves like no other she's recorded, and nothing on Light Years was as funky as the pure disco closer of "Burning Up." And while it's hard not to notice her tipping her hat to the teen pop sound (in fact, on this record she works with Cathy Dennis, former dance-pop star and writer/producer for Brit-teen pop group S Club 7) on songs like "Give It to Me" and "Love at First Sight," her maturity helps transcend this limiting tag, making this a very stylish Euro-flavored dance-pop record that will appeal to all ages. Not one weak track, not one misplaced syrupy ballad to ruin the groove. The winning streak continues. [The U.S. version, released in early March of 2002, included the hidden tracks "Boy" and "Butterfly" -- a B-side and Light Years album track, respectively.]© Chris True /TiVo	21	CD	2026-01-18 21:53:00.164424	2
330955	DISCO	Kylie Minogue	392.95	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/fc/i7/ufomxxie4i7fc_600.jpg	qobuz:98565917|ufomxxie4i7fc	The cover of Kylie Minogue's 15th album lets you know that, after a foray into country pop with 2018's Golden, the dance-floor queen is back—shellacked with turquoise eyeshadow and fire engine red lipstick, decked out in Studio 54 curls and chandelier earrings, and lit by disco-ball sparkle. Largely recorded at her London home during 2020's pandemic lockdown restrictions, DISCO is escapist fantasy. Feel-good music. Audio oxytocin. Opener "Magic" is a joyous 24-karat breeze of shimmering Phoenix-style synths, thumping percussion, shameless horns and infectious handclaps. The bright tropical brass and sweeping keyboards —not to mention that "whoo-whoo" backing chorus—of "I Love It" is like a shot of Vitamin C. And that's the thing with Minogue: For all that synth, these songs are warm and intimate. Even with talk-box effects, the Daft Punk-esque "Real Groove" ("Got that perfect body/ But she ain't got the moves," coos the eternally youthful 52-year-old) feels superbly human; you can easily imagine crowds happily twirling to the music. Merengue-flavored "Monday Blues" conjures up a street party dance scene and the "Xanadu"-meets-electropop "Say Something" should be the anthem of the pandemic's roller-skating revival. But there's also something appealingly melancholy in the longing of slinky "Miss A Thing"—a FOMO for the world's former "normal": "Come dance with me...I don't want to miss a thing." Yes, please. There are shades of Chic in the funk guitars of "Last Chance," and early Wham! vibes exude from "Where Does The DJ Go?" Meanwhile, "Celebrate You" improbably borrows from Saint Etienne, '60s girl groups, late '90s R&B and playground chants, to delightful effect. At once nostalgic and totally fresh, DISCO taps exactly into the zeitgeist by offering a shot of comfort and aspiration instead of complaints. And when quarantines finally lift and concerts return, we can count on one thing. Minogue’s shows will be dance parties. © Shelly Ridenour/Qobuz	28	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:53:13.477079	1

This time around, she's bringing an electro-pop strobe to the dance floor —and, at 55, proving age really doesn't mean anything. While Madonna has been spinning fruitlessly in search of reinvention, Minogue just keeps nailing trends and staying refreshingly relevant. "Padam Padam"—the onomatopoeic sound of a heartbeat—lives in a metallic echo chamber, carefully curated by producer Lostboy and decorated with an infectious snake-charmer chorus. "I'll be in your head all weekend," Minogue sings prophetically. "Tension" goes deep with '90s house keyboards and beats, and a robotic effect for Mingoue's sexy come-on, directing exactly how she wants to be handled by a lover—"Oh, my god/ Touch me right there/ Almost there/ touch me right there"—while also also making it clear she is completely in control: "I'm a star babe-babe-babe/ Do this all day-day-day/ Cool like sorbet-bet-bet." She works all her vocal tricks on tropical-vibe "One More Time": cooing, showing powerhouse strength, effortlessly hitting the high notes, sassing and whooping and sweating it. (Even though it's not a direct tribute, you can't help but be reminded by Daft Punk's monster hit of the same name.) "Green Light" is cool-breeze cafe pop with smooooooth jazz sax. "Things We Do for Love" delivers an energetic burst of euphoria with a shiny soap bubble of a bridge. "You Still Get Me High" fronts like a prom ballad before erupting into an emo-beat thriller, with wailing sax upping the adrenaline; it's like Kylie x Bleachers, and it's fun. "Hands" finds Minogue casually rapping and delighting in '90s girl-group R&B. "Vegas High" captures that city's cut-loose party vibe and is obviously a tie-in for her residency at the Venetian, which begins November 2023. But she makes up for that bit of cheesiness with "10 Out of 10,"  a goofy, giddy lark of a collaboration with Dutch DJ Oliver Heldens that delivers a Pet Shop Boys-style droll chorus: "Body, 10/ Touch, 10 / Energy, 10." Kylie: 10.  © Shelly Ridenour/Qobuz	32	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:53:13.477082	1

Firstly, she shows a lot more personality than the other Stock, et al. frontperson, Rick Astley. Secondly, her cuteness makes these rather vapid tracks bearable. Her cover of "The Loco-Motion" made only small waves in the U.S., but this was the album that launched her career as both pop star and icon in Europe.© Chris True /TiVo	22	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:53:13.477082	1

Kylie effortlessly blends the adrenaline rush of a photoshoot with the energy of the dance floor, playing both the star and the director in the music video directed by Sophie Muller. In the final shot, like Gloria Swanson in the film ‘Sunset Boulevard’, Kylie is seen watching her own film, alone in her private screening room. The song’s lyrics layer on these meta references, even name-dropping another pop icon, Madonna, with the playful line: "I look stellar tonight, my armour is by Gaultier." Madonna’s influence is made clear again in the track "Edge of Saturday Night," where Kylie takes a lighthearted approach to the legendary ‘In Bed With Madonna’ documentary. In the music video, we see Kylie Minogue and American producer and DJ The Blessed Madonna partying on a bed in the middle of a lively celebration. The other tracks on this sixteenth album from the Australian singer are made in the same vein, combining an unapologetic mix of irony, playful gimmicks, and beats crafted for the dance floor. Besides The Blessed Madonna, Tension II boasts a diverse lineup of features, including Orville Peck, Bebe Rexha, Tove Lo, and Sia. © Nicolas Magenham/Qobuz	16	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:53:13.477083	1

Obviously the backlash of 1997's Impossible Princess taught the diminutive Aussie one important lesson. Sometimes you have to just go with what you know -- go back to basics. And that's just what Minogue has done with 2000's Light Years. Symbolically dropping her last name from the cover, she re-enters the territory that made her great. Granted, with the teen pop movement at its strongest, one could say she just has good timing, but this work is leaps and bounds better than her Stock-Aitken-Waterman work. Light Years is not just another Minogue dance-pop record, but a great collection of disco stylings and Europop kitsch. "Spinning Around" is a fun and string-laden declaration that she may have made a mistake back in 1997, and the Robbie Williams/Guy Chambers-penned "Your Disco Needs You" is probably one of the best dance songs of the '90s. Arguably one of the best disco records since the '70s, Light Years is Minogue comfortable with who she is and what she's good at.© Chris True /TiVo	6	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:53:13.477083	1
434616	The Abbey Road Sessions	Kylie Minogue	47.49	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/8b/ge/j3242l1m5ge8b_600.jpg	qobuz:51363377|j3242l1m5ge8b	During her 25-year career in the music biz, Kylie Minogue’s ability to re-invent herself and stay current is rivaled only by Madonna’s. Unlike her American counterpart, though, Kylie’s changes never seem desperate, and everything she does exudes a touch of class that makes her shifts seem far more organic. From chirpy teen popper to indie diva to dance-pop heavyweight, every step she’s taken has made perfect sense and in the process, she’s released some of the best pop records of her era. In 2012, as part of her own look back at the highlights of a long and successful career, Kylie and her band went to Abbey Road studios to run through a selection of her biggest hits and best songs. Joined by an array of backing singers and an orchestra, the songs are re-imagined in ways that bring out the underlying emotions behind the glittery pop facades. Stripping the songs down to their basics and then adding strings on top proves to be very effective, especially on “All the Lovers” or “Hand on Your Heart,” and most of the new arrangements are imaginative and sometime inspired. The piano ballad version of “Better the Devil You Know” works very well, as does the sultry trip-hop take on “Slow,” while the strings and vocals on “I Should Be So Lucky” turn the song into a classy '30s musical showstopper. The most interesting reboot takes place on “Can’t Get You Out of My Head” where the insistent strings push the song along with a tightly coiled electricity that is impossible to resist. The only song that really falls flat is the cutesy, Motown-inspired take on “The Locomotion.” Though Kylie may not have the strongest voice around, she has more than enough charm and understated emotional strength to fill the more intimate arrangements with a solid and exceedingly warm center. The album stands as both as a reminder of all the classic pop songs Kylie has released and of her fearless nature. She’s always been willing to take risks, and despite the initial thought that her music may not stand up to the orchestral treatment, The Abbey Road Sessions is another victory in a career full of them.© Tim Sendra /TiVo	6	CD	2026-01-18 21:53:13.477083	2
335834	Golden	Kylie Minogue	360.5	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/ra/7j/tknqnm1jr7jra_600.jpg	qobuz:48616167|tknqnm1jr7jra	After a long career full of many course corrections and detours, it seemed like Kylie Minogue was locked into being a shiny, glittery dance pop icon for life. A label change and some personal turmoil in the form of a soul-shattering breakup sent Minogue looking for something new musically. When planning her first album for BMG, a label rep asked if she had ever thought of recording country music in Nashville and she jumped at the chance. For 2018's Golden, Minogue went to Music City, got to work writing songs with some seasoned pros, and ended up co-writing all the songs on the record. It's heartbreaking and uplifting in turn as she makes sense of where her heart has taken her, set to the tune of fiddles, guitars, and woodsy backing vocals along with the more traditional synths, drum machines, and club beats one usually hears on a Minogue album. She and her team of musicians, writers, and producers straddle the line between twang and glitter on just about every song; sometimes, it leans more in favor of line dancing, sometimes the glitter ball takes over, especially on the shimmering "Raining Glitter." Sometimes, like on "Live a Little" or the very hooky single "Dancing," it's the best of both worlds. It's an interesting mix that puts her in line with much of what's happening in mainstream country. Certainly, the difference between most of Golden and, say, Kacey Musgraves' 2018 album is almost non-existent. The amazing thing about the album, and about Minogue, is that she pulls off the country as well as she's pulled off new wave, disco, electro, murder ballads, and everything else she's done in her long career. Her voice may not have the depth of some of the great Nashville singers, but she has tons of personality, and when she cuts loose there's more than a little Dolly Parton in her artistic DNA. She also does a fine job on ballads -- letting the heartbreak flow on "Radio On" and sounding like both Tegan and Sara on "Sincerely Yours." Golden is an odd detour for Minogue, and it's hard to imagine that the record will get much traction on the country side of the equation -- there's a strong chance her less devoted fans might find the new sound a little too much. As an artistic statement, it's pretty darn bold, though, and proves that she's still game for just about anything and able to make whatever she does sound exactly like herself.© Tim Sendra /TiVo	8	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:53:13.477084	1

She and her team do it right, providing a varied and diverse selection of tracks and moods. Of course, there are plenty of holiday favorites, and old chestnuts like "Winter Wonderland" and "Let It Snow!" are done up Vegas-style with horns, strings, and plenty of schmaltz. There are a couple of fun diversions, like her snappy cover of the fun Connie Francis song from the '50s, "I'm Gonna Be Warm This Winter," or a sentimental cover of Yaz's "Only You," done as a duet with James Corden. The cover of the Waitresses' "Christmas Wrapping" adds a little punch to the proceedings, her version of the Pretenders' "2000 Miles" adds a few tears, and the originals she adds to the mix -- the modern pop ballad "Every Day's Like Christmas" and two girl group-inspired tunes ("White December," "Christmas Isn't Christmas Until You Get Here") -- all sound like winners. Throughout the album, Kylie sounds very game, merry even, and there's enough holiday spirit on offer to help even the grinchiest customer make it through the season with the bare minimum of humbug.© Tim Sendra /TiVo	30	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:53:13.477084	1

She backed up the new material with a collection (Ultimate Kylie) that boasted excellent new material as well. All things seemed to be destined for further glory. And then, unfortunately, cancer hit. While she did recover fully from her illness, there was speculation on how she would deal with this event, and how her music and choice of collaborators would be affected. Many artists have come back from a potentially life-threatening disease with work that is a flat-out declaration of victory, songs and images that are thinly shrouded metaphors for rebirth or newfound strength. Therefore, it must have surprised many that the leadoff from Kylie's new record would be "2 Hearts," a '70s-style Roxy Music-esque glam jam that clocks in at under three minutes, and is -- seemingly -- devoid of any sort of "I'm back from the brink" anthemizing. Couple this pop gem with the gaudy early-'80s artwork, and the buzz was that Kylie was not only back, but back with a Me Decade swagger and ready to take back the momentum she'd been building since 2000. But to call X an '80s record is really only getting halfway there. Sure, the cover art is vintage 1982, and the majority of the record calls on production tricks and techniques that are of the same time, but much of the record calls on different eras -- not generalized decades as such, but eras in Kylie's own career. Most of the tracks could have fit in on earlier work, answering the question: what does a pop artist do when she's come full circle? She's been influenced as of late by '70s disco and '80s electro, but with X, it feels like Kylie has decided to take inspiration from Kylie herself. But there's more here than just that. From a musical standpoint, X is all over the map. If that's due in part or in whole to reassessing one's career, that's all well and good, but after the last three albums, it is not what her fans have really come to expect. To break it all down: after the nod to the days of Roxy and Bowie and Bolan in the aforementioned lead single (and fantastic album opener) -- which has a very warm, organic feel to it, almost conjuring up the heart musically -- the electronics kick in and an icy chill fills the room. From then on the album bounces back and forth from cold, calculated dance-pop that is more indicative of her recent work ("Like a Drug," "In My Arms," "Heart Beat Rock," "The One") and more personal, expansive work à la 1997's Impossible Princess and 1994's Kylie Minogue ("Sensitized," "Stars," "Cosmic"). While some of it is very very good (Guy Chambers' "Sensitized" is arguably the best track on the album, so much so that it's disappointing that she didn't work with him more on X), most of it lacks -- when all presented as a whole -- what the last few collections really had: consistency. X isn't a "piece" as, say, Light Years was. It feels more like an artist trying to make sure she has all her bases covered. She even touches -- for the most part -- on her recent illness with the admittedly strong "No More Rain." But while tracks like "Nu-di-ty" and "Speakerphone" would have sounded better on the last Robbie Williams record and working with Bloodshy & Avant is questionable from time to time, the majority of X is exactly what it's meant to be: a collection of songs by a pop artist who is aware of her past achievements and doubly aware of her need to stay relevant in the face of unwanted diversion.© Christopher M.

Most artists who’ve stuck around for that long end up rehashing their past catalogs and/or growing stale, but Kylie manages to avoid these fates by constantly working with new collaborators, keeping up on musical trends without pandering to them, and most importantly, never taking herself too seriously. Sure, she’s serious about making great dance music, but she never confuses her status as a pop icon with a desire to send out a message in her music. Aphrodite rarely strays past sweet love songs or happy dance anthems; its deepest message is “everything is beautiful.” You have to credit the songwriters (big names like Jake Shears of Scissor Sisters and Calvin Harris, as well as behind-the-scenes people like Sebastian Ingrosso, and Pascal Gabriel) for tailoring the efforts to Kylie’s strengths. Also on board is exec producer Stuart Price, who puts it all together, giving the record a focused sound that was lacking on her previous record, X, which touched convincingly on a myriad of styles and influences, but which ended up sounding a little scattered. Here the main sound is the kind of glittery disco pop that really is her strong suit. The various producers keep their eyes on the dancefloor throughout, crafting shiny and sleek tracks that sound custom-built to blast out of huge speaker columns. Fortunately for non-club goers, they never pave over the interesting details that make records good for home or headphone listening.The squiggly synths of the massively catchy “All the Lovers,” the sighing background vocals and spiraling harpsichord-esque synths on the ominous "Closer," and the heavenly extended breakdown on “Looking for an Angel” are the kind of hooks that reward repeated listens. While Kylie is fortunate that so many excellent writers and producers are willing to work with her, they are lucky to be working with Kylie too; she can put over a shimmering and funky track like “Can’t Beat the Feeling” with ease, stomp through a dancefloor-filling jam like “Put Your Hands Up” with power, or cruise through a breezy summertime jam like “Better Than Today” with all kinds of laid-back charm. Sure, she’ll never be mistaken for an octave-stretching diva or a vocal powerhouse, but her slightly nasal, girl-next-door vocals serve her needs perfectly. She soars through the songs with just the right blend of emotion and restraint, adding some sass when needed (as on the thumping title track or “Get Outta My Way”) or some quiet melancholy when the mood arises (“Illusion”). This ability to tailor her performance to the song is a rare quality in the pop world of the early 2010s. It may lead people to underestimate Kylie's artistry but really, Aphrodite is the work of someone who knows exactly what her skills are and who to hire to help showcase them to perfection. She and her team have crafted an album that’s both full of songs that could/should hit the upper reaches of the charts, and also a collection of songs that hang together as an album. One of her best, in fact.© Tim Sendra /TiVo	19	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:53:13.477085	1
289332	Step Back In Time: The Definitive Collection 	Kylie Minogue	267.44	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/tb/jo/ekxe6bp4rjotb_600.jpg	qobuz:75603595|ekxe6bp4rjotb	Step Back In Time: The Definitive Collection is Kylie Minogue’s fourth ‘greatest hits’ release in her career, a testament to her ability to keep producing timeless bangers that blend nostalgic club beats with catchy melodies: pop, plain and simple. Since the beginning of her music career, way back in 1987, Kylie has surfed the wave of different eras of pop: the standard origins of the late 80s, the dance-driven 90s followed by a move towards the inclusion of electro beats in the 2000s and 2010s. Nevertheless, the sound has always remained distinctly Kylie: upbeat, sparkling anthems that are never impossible to dance to.  The first twenty-two tracks are dedicated to her most recent, post-millenium hits, highlights including the inescapable Can’t Get You out of My Head, Love at First Sight and Wow, as well as the only new song, New York City. These are closely followed by a nostalgic trip down memory lane with a selection of Kylie’s more disco-infused hits like I Should Be So Lucky, Better the Devil You Know and the track that kickstarted the success of her career, The Loco-Motion. This Expanded edition includes eight more songs from various different previous albums, and finishes off with an F9 Megamix section, on which eighteen of Minogue’s biggest tunes have been edited together into one non-stop, 40-minute-long party mix. Fans of the pop megastar will de delighted with this compilation, which leaves us with only one question: what does Kylie have in store for the 2020s? © Christopher Steele/Qobuz	12	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:53:13.477086	1

Eight years later, after two more albums with the Black Eyed Peas, she released the first single off what became her follow-up. "L.A.LOVE (La La)," outfitted with co-production from DJ Mustard and a verse from YG, and shouts to many other locations including Kingston and Jamaica, arrived just after the somewhat Fergalicious Iggy Azalea crashed the mainstream. It wasn't nearly as successful as the debut's singles -- not in the U.S., at least -- but it did go platinum. Three more years passed prior to the arrival of Double Dutchess, which seemed to signal some hesitancy, though the period was likely lengthened by Fergie's split from Interscope and the establishment of her BMG-supported Dutchess Music label. With a little help from BEP partner will.i.am, and input from past and new cross-genre production associates ranging from Toby Gad and Polow da Don to Cirkut and Alesso, Double Dutchess is similar to The Dutchess in makeup. It mixes nostalgic and contemporary rap elements, applies references to various global sounds, and veers from cartoonish club tracks and belting pop ballads. Fergie's in typically uninhibited, sometimes irreverent form, commanding "Ladies, rub on your titties" (on a track where she also recalls Salt-N-Pepa and Audio Two), swapping carefree verses with Nicki Minaj over the inexhaustible "Think (About It)" break, singing in falsetto over slick neo-disco, and wailing in the red on the cathartic finale. Amid all the sensible updates to the debut's approach is a slight surprise, "Enchanté (Carine)," a loopy, sugary French-English number with Fergie's son along for the ride, sounding like the second coming of Jordy. Fergie is demonstrably energized, and having a ball with nothing left to prove.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	22	CD	2026-01-18 21:53:28.532925	2

That has been the lone consistent characteristic of her output, and it remains in effect throughout The Dutchess. The album has all the characteristics of a release fronted by someone who has been itching to go solo and prove herself, once and for all, as a versatile force all her own. Fergie does cartwheels and handstands, juggles three objects at once, balances books on her head, hangs upside down, rides a unicycle with her hands in the air -- all these things while wearing different outfits. The whole process, produced mostly by fellow Pea will.i.am, is mildly entertaining. There's throwback hip-hop ("Fergalicious," done to the tune of J.J. Fad's "Supersonic"), throwback soul ("Here I Come," done to the tune of the Temptations' "Get Ready"), reggae ("Mary Jane Shoes"), ska-punk ("Mary Jane Shoes"), scat ("Mary Jane Shoes"), vaguely torchy midtempo fluff ("Velvet"), and a classy string-drenched ballad (the appropriately titled "Finally"), among several other passable switch-ups, along with "London Bridge" -- which is terrific, provided you can block out the lyrics or prevent yourself from trying to decipher its meaning. One of the more convincing songs on the album, "Big Girls Don't Cry," sounds exactly like a 2006 version of Wild Orchid, with Fergie's Taylor Dayne kid-sister act in full effect.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	18	CD	2026-01-18 21:53:28.532928	2

Most things about Stripped suggest sex, actually, since Xtina -- as she calls herself in a handful of interviews accompanying the release of the album -- never hesitates to put her body, her piercings, and recently liberated sexual beliefs on display throughout her hyper-sexual, convoluted sophomore effort. Like any diva, Christina believes her trials and tribulations are inherently more fascinating than anybody else's and, like any diva, she has an inflated sense of self-importance, defiantly strutting on the "Stripped Intro" that she's "sorry you can't define me/sorry I break the mold." What she's referring to is anybody's guess, since she hasn't exactly defied expectations since her last album -- releasing a Christmas album and a Spanish-language record of your debut ain't exactly breaking the mold: it is the mold. Plus, Stripped clearly has its origins in the sound of two of Christina's teen pop contemporaries -- the teasing sexiness of Britney Spears and the wonderful, gonzo dance-rock confessionals of P!nk, who truly did break the mold with M!ssundaztood. Since Aguilera spent so much time working on the album, tearing through a seemingly countless number of producers, she seems desperate to not just catch-up with these two, but surpass them in sex and confessions, breaking it down so they become the same thing, while adding a strong hip-hop undercurrent throughout all the songs. And the end result is utterly bizarre, surpassing Mariah Carey's Glitter as the modern-day standard for musical immolation while rivaling The Teaches of Peaches in its sheer carnality. Where Peaches is always in control of her sexuality, using it as a weapon and a joke in equal measures, Christina is overwhelmed by the reaction of others to her sexuality, putting it on equal ground with her voice, which remains a remarkably powerful instrument, especially since she's toned down the scale-running histrionics from her debut. If she's mastered her vocals, she's still desperately searching for her artistic voice, placing too much emphasis on club and street-level R&B, which fit her poorly (why "Dirrty," a non-song that requires less range, over the slinky sexiness of "I'm a Slave 4 U," the first single?), when she needs full-blown songs. There are some here, though, most notably the Linda Perry collaboration "Beautiful," which was rush-released as a second single, but the ceaseless 70-minute running time and seemingly endless 20 songs mean that individual moments are lost and the big picture remains. And that big picture is that of an artist who has grown up too fast, while the sound is that of an artist who's given too much freedom too early and hasn't yet figured out what to do with it.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	6	CD	2026-01-18 21:53:30.476896	2
135655	Christina Aguilera	Christina Aguilera	185.16	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/74/16/0888880771674_600.jpg	qobuz:13017140|0888880771674	Since Christina Aguilera is the third and last of the New Mickey Mouse Club alumni to hit the charts in the mid-'90s -- following two members of 'N Sync and Britney Spears -- it's easy for cynical observers to assume that she was the lesser of the three talents since she arrived last after everyone scaled the charts. That's not the case at all. If anything, Aguilera is the best of the three, blessed with a rich voice that's given the material it deserves. Her eponymous debut remains firmly within the teen-oriented dance-pop genre, but unlike Spears' album, this is done right. The songwriting is strong -- the ballads are engaging, the dance numbers are catchy -- the production is clean and uncluttered, letting Aguilera's voice take the foreground. Most impressively, she not only has charisma, she can actually sing, bringing conviction to these love and heartbreak songs. So, Christina Aguilera may be lightweight, but it's lightweight in the best possible sense -- breezy, fun, engaging, and enjoyable on each repeated listen. Out of the deluge of teen-pop albums in 1999, this feels like the best of the lot.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	30	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:53:42.870337	1

Since Aguilera had Ecuadoran heritage, recording a Latin pop album was appropriate, even if she didn't know how to speak the language. Besides, a Latin album was an easy way to buy time for an artist waiting to produce an eagerly awaited sequel to a blockbuster album. So, she knocked out the record that became Mi Reflejo in 1999 and 2000, between tours and video shoots. She learned the words phonetically, but she already knew most of the melodies, since the bulk of the album was Spanish-language versions of songs on the debut album. In other words, it was a mirror image of the debut -- her Spanish reflection, as it were. This results in an album that is just a little too familiar, even if it's classy and well-produced and spiked with a couple of new tunes that hold their own with the holdovers. Even so, it's hard to view Mi Reflejo as anything other than a bit of a pleasant holding pattern; it's enjoyable as it spins, but it doesn't add anything new to her music, since it's just the old music in new clothing.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	12	CD	2026-01-18 21:53:42.870341	2

The four stars blended their talents together perfectly, and the song, based on airplay alone, topped the U.S. pop charts for five weeks during the summer of 2001. The song was from the film Moulin Rouge, and its video, featuring the four scantily clad vixens, was as colorful and vibrant as the film itself, no doubt adding to the song's success. With rock guitars, dance beats, and a playful (albeit highly materialistic) rap courtesy of Lil' Kim (which in turn added a more modern twist to the song), the blend possessed all the necessary ingredients to become one of 2001's biggest international hits. In the U.S., however, no commercial single was released for the song, which, in this case, didn't impede its chart success. Arguably the best import single for this tune is the German import (the British contains only three tracks), which includes the radio version as well as three unstoppable dance remixes (one being a single edit) courtesy of Thunderpuss, one of the hottest remixing teams of the late '90s/early '00s. Especially fun is the song's finale, where Elliott briefly introduces each of the four artists, and each gal vamps it up in her signature style. A huge summertime hit, and the first U.S. chart-topper for Lil' Kim, Mya, and Pink (Christina Aguilera had already scored three).© Jose F. Promis /TiVo	32	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:53:42.870342	1

Her last, and certainly not her best, was Lotus. The time since then has been relatively tough, and Christina Aguilera has had to contend with the complexities of a different world: television. A recurrent actor in the series Nashville, she quickly became a prisoner of a role that should have just been a job. But a bitter ball of anger was growing in her day after day. She had built her empire in music, not on a soap opera set; and never mind how long she'd been away, she would break her chains and, now aged 37, she signed off on a warlike record: Liberation. Her weapons? A strong base of hip-hop dressed up in pop, R&B and rock, and above all the powerful voice of rebel women. Because the #MeToo has seen Aguilera reveal more of her feminist side in a hip-hop world she accuses of misogyny. She has matured and become self-assured. For this eighth album, Kanye West wrote several tracks, including the sensational Maria and Accelerate. Demi Lovato comes in for a duet, Fall in Line a war-song, where women are soldiers commanded by a man's voice. It's a way of fighting against certain clichés, in a spirit of strength and rebellion. Aguilera has lost none of the intensity of her voice, the ingenuity that sees her bringing in children's choirs, synth melodies or sensual, emotional ballads. Liberation is more than just a hip-hop album, but the reconstruction of a woman, a benevolent cry that aims to bring comfort to those who, like her, have known trying times. Everything here has been subtly calculated to transmit a message through music that, like Aguilera herself, has evolved. © Clara Bismuth/Qobuz	21	CD	2026-01-18 21:53:42.870343	2

As the 2000s rolled on, Aguilera slowly, surely began to eclipse Spears. Brit-Brit's downward spiral and arrested artistic development seemed all the stronger when compared to Xtina's restless risks and increasingly assured musical vision, a progression that's evident on Keeps Gettin' Better: A Decade of Hits. Arranged chronologically from 1999's "Genie in a Bottle" to 2007's "Candyman," Keeps Gettin' Better has a narrative momentum: the squeaky-clean pop singer shatters her image via hyper-sexualized dance tracks which left her free to get crazier, campier, and better, turning into a pop diva that truly deserves that title. Keeps Gettin' Better hints at the future with two excellent new songs (the title track and "Dynamite") along with remakes of "Genie in a Bottle" and "Beautiful,"" all done in a chilly electro style that suggests a Blackout if Britney were in control and knew what she was doing, but what is remarkable about the collection is that Christina's past holds up, with the candy-pop of "Genie," "What a Girl Wants," and "Come on Over Baby (All I Want Is You)" still sounding sweet, "Beautiful" sounding richly melancholy, and "Ain't No Other Man" and "Candyman" wickedly funny, knowing blasts of retro-swing. She may have started out in Britney's shadow, but Keeps Gettin' Better proves that no other teen pop singer of her era has a better track record than Christina and if the new songs are any indication, the title of this hits comp is no lie either.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	7	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:53:42.870343	1
203446	Ultraviolence	Lana Del Rey	310.91	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/70/65/0060253786570_600.jpg	qobuz:17313975|0060253786570	The maelstrom of hype surrounding self-modeled Hollywood pop star Lana Del Rey's 2012 breakthrough album, Born to Die, found critics, listeners, and pop culture aficionados divided about her detached, hyper-stylized approach to every aspect of her music and public persona. What managed to get overlooked by many was that Born to Die made such a polarizing impression because it actually offered something that didn't sound like anything else. Del Rey's sultry, overstated orchestral pop recast her as some sort of vaguely imagined chanteuse for a generation raised on Adderall and the Internet, with heavy doses of Twin Peaks atmosphere adding a creepy sheen to intentionally vapid (and undeniably catchy) radio hits. Follow-up album Ultraviolence shifts gears considerably, building a thick, slow-moving atmosphere with its languid songs and opulent arrangements. Gone are the big beats and glossy production that resulted in tracks like "Summertime Sadness." Instead, Ultraviolence begins with the protracted, rolling melancholia of "Cruel World," nearly seven minutes of what feels like a sad, reverb-drenched daydream. The song sets the stage for the rest of the album, which simmers with a haunted, yearning feeling but never boils over. Even the most pop-friendly moments here are steeped in patient, jazz-inflected moodiness, as with the sad-eyed longing of "Shades of Cool" or the unexpected tempo changes that connect the slinky verses of single "West Coast" to their syrupy, swaying choruses. Production from the Black Keys' Dan Auerbach might have something to do with the metered restraint that permeates the album, with songs like "Sad Girl" carrying some of the slow-burning touches of greasy blues-rock Auerbach is known for. A few puzzling moments break up the continuity of the album. The somewhat hooky elements of "Brooklyn Baby" can't quite rise above its disjointed song structure and cringeable lyrics that could be taken either as mockery of the hipster lifestyle or self-parody. "Money Power Glory" steps briefly out of the overall dreamscape of the album, sounding like a tossed-off outtake from the Born to Die sessions. Despite these mild missteps, Ultraviolence thrives for the most part in its density, meant clearly to be absorbed as an entire experience, with even its weaker pieces contributing to a mood that's consumptive, sexy, and as eerie as big-budget pop music gets. Del Rey's loudest detractors criticized her music as a hollow, cliché-ridden product designed by the music industry and lacking the type of substance that makes real pop stars pop. Ultraviolence asserts that as a songwriter, she has complete control of her craft, deciding on songs far less flashy or immediate but still uniquely captivating. As these songs shift her sound into more mature and nuanced places, it becomes clear that every deadpan affectation, lispy lyric, and overblown allusion to desperate living has been a knowing move in the creation of the strange, beguiling character -- and sonic experience -- we know as Lana Del Rey.© Fred Thomas /TiVo	31	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:18.428522	1

Her second Spanish-language effort after 2000's Mi Reflejo, the set arrived in pieces throughout early 2022, split into three EP chapters she dubbed La Fuerza, La Tormenta, and La Luz. The trilogy came together that May, revealing one of the strongest statements for the singer since the 2000s. Buffered by a wide swath of subgenres like urbano, cumbia, reggaeton, and more, Aguilera finds its namesake invigorated and in top form. On early showstopper "Pa Mis Muchachas," Aguilera recruits Becky G, Nathy Peluso, and Nicki Nicole for a star-studded empowerment anthem that ends with a shiver-inducing vocal run that could bring the house down. Across the album, big-bass boomers fit for blasting at maximum volume keep the energy elevated, with the popping "Como Yo" and the urgent "Traguito" as standout earworms. Slowing it down, the piano-backed ballad "Somos Nada" sits alongside its most heart-rending siblings on Stripped. Elsewhere, more traditional singalong moments such as "La Reina" and "Cuando Me Dé la Gana" slide up alongside sultry, yearning temptations like "Suéltame" and "Ya Llegué." The project closes with the cinematic "No Es Que Te Extrañe," an unexpected moment of high drama that was written about finding closure and forgiveness. Aguilera is a refreshing burst of artistry and heart from the Y2K generation's strongest voice, adding an unexpected late-era highlight to her extensive catalog.© Neil Z.

It's a mature sound and one that builds nicely upon her genre-blending 2020 studio album Rare, which found Gomez pushing the stylistic boundaries of her mainstream aesthetic, experimenting with French disco, R&B, and some Latin-influenced rhythms. It was also one of her most intimate-sounding albums, revealing diary-like lyrics about personal feelings and desires. On Revelación, she remains just as artistically fearless, embracing her Latin roots and further pushing her sound in a sophisticated pop direction. While she has sung a little in Spanish in the past, Gomez (whose father is Mexican and who is named after the iconic Tejano singer Selena Quintanilla) had never made an album sung so largely in the language. Helping her bring the ideas to fruition here are a small cadre of producers, including Albert Hype, Jota Rosa, Neon16, and Tainy, among others. Together they craft a hypnotic blend of alternative R&B, Latin pop, and reggaeton, framing Gomez's intimate vocals in textured synths, dense bass grooves, and clipped electronic beats. Gomez has grown significantly as a performer since her early Disney years and Revelación further underlines that transformation.© Matt Collar /TiVo	13	CD	2026-01-18 21:54:31.51542	2

After an album, 2011's When the Sun Goes Down, that streamlined her sound into a sleek and shiny pop rocket with both eyes on the dancefloor, Stars Dance takes a (slightly) more eclectic approach. Gomez and her team of writers and producers don't stray far from the dancefloor and party jams, and these are the strongest songs on the album. It's hard to resist the jumping beats, shiny synths, and Gomez's cheery vocals on tracks like "Slow Down," "Undercover," and the disco-y "Save the Day." Even when she's lamenting her mostly broken heart, as on the thumping "Forget Forever" or the loping "Write Your Name," it's hard to keep from wanting to hit the dancefloor. The only sad song that makes you want to stop and cry a little is the seriously bummed "Love Will Remember." Like her previous albums, though, there are a few surprises this time out. Not that a song being influenced by dubstep in 2013 is really shocking, since even tissue commercials have a dubstep sound, but her take on it, the moody title track, at least does a decent job of integrating the rippling bass and thudding tempo into Gomez's world. The bubblegum twerk jam "B.E.A.T." is lots of fun, the tablas add a nice mystical touch to "Come & Get It," and somehow she doesn't sound completely ridiculous imitating Buju Banton on the dancehall jam "Like a Champion," which samples his song "Champion" -- instead, she just sounds spunky. The only song that falls flat is the opening "Birthday," which can't overcome some very bad lyrics (shouting "Jazz it up!" is never a good idea) and a forced Spring Breakers feeling that the rest of the album doesn't have. It's the only track where Selena sounds like she's trying too hard and it's a little embarrassing, which is something she's never been on record before. Fortunately, it's the only song that might require skipping, since the rest of the album is so much better. Stars Dance is another fine entry in her catalog and just another example of why Selena Gomez is one of the best pop stars making music in 2013.© Tim Sendra /TiVo	11	CD	2026-01-18 21:54:31.515421	2

494379	thank u, next (Explicit)	Ariana Grande	258.13	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/nc/hb/lqlu8lhwdhbnc_600.jpg	qobuz:58825640|lqlu8lhwdhbnc	The hyperactive Ariana Grande is back with thank u, next, just seven months after the release of Sweetener. And, most importantly, following the fatal overdose of British rapper Mac Miller, her ex-boyfriend. With this title, following a brief romance with comedian Pete Davidson, Ariana reinforces her image as a strong woman, despite her young age (25 years old) and her career’s past hardships. Pop music caramelised with some R&B, the twelve tracks of this fifth album − produced to perfection by Tommy Brown − forthrightly lift the veil on her former relationships. With her four-octave voice, the mini Mariah Carey, also known as Ari, is walking in the footsteps of Mimi in the 1990s and 2000s, and it shows (NASA)! And for a whiff of soul, she even dares sample Wendy Rene’s soul-crushing After Laughter (“After laughter comes tears”) on fake smile and adds the perfect amount of brass on bloodline. Shattering streaming records, the pop star knows how to surround herself and even co-wrote thank u, next with Victoria Monét. © Charlotte Saintoin/Qobuz	9	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:53:46.045565	1
715621	Dangerous Woman (Deluxe Edition)	Ariana Grande	258.4	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/11/55/0060254795511_600.jpg	qobuz:32261455|0060254795511	Ariana Grande took her first tentative steps into adulthood with My Everything, the 2014 album that tempered her retro-diva stance with modern R&B. Released two years later, Dangerous Woman consolidates this soulful shift while offering a snazzier, sophisticated spin on the '90s pop that provides the foundation of Grande's music. Much of the latter comes from a fruitful partnership with producer Max Martin and his colleague Ilya, a team responsible for over half of the standard album's tracks (they also have their hands in several of the deluxe edition's bonus cuts). Tommy Brown and Mr. Franks are the other chief collaborators here, shepherding many of the cuts with a heavier R&B influence -- the stuttering "Let Me Love You," featuring a verse from Lil Wayne, the slow-burning torch of "Leave Me Lonely" -- but their productions aren't far removed from the Martin/Ilya cuts. "Everyday," a heavy thrumming jam featuring Future, is helmed by Ilya alone and the Rihanna-copping "Side to Side" bears a Martin credit. What all the producers do is keep the focus on the individual track, carving it into a seamless sculpture of rhythm and melody where Grande winds up as the accent to the song. Restraint serves her well: there are times she lets go with a full-throated roar, but she spends most of Dangerous Woman at a simmer that reinforces the sultry seduction of the title. A fair chunk of the album is devoted to cinematic ballads, which makes the bright blasts of disco -- "Be Alright," "Greedy" -- so alluring, but the entire record benefits from this single-minded concentration. Track by track, Dangerous Woman has sly, subtle distinctions -- a little bit of torch gives way to some heavy hip-hop only to have frothy pop surface again -- and while some of these cuts work better than others, the range is impressive, as is Grande's measured, assured performance.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	20	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:53:46.04557	1

Mostly a response to the headline-grabbing details of her relationships, as usual, the conceptual journey takes listeners through the dissolution of one union (which ended in divorce) and the slow healing that was aided along by the sparks of another (which generated no small amount of controversy). The bulk of the lyrics are a direct reference to the drama, with Grande taking the high road with poise and class, while leaning into any negative perceptions with a wink and some sass. Those tabloid-fodder moments (like "The Boy Is Mine" and "True Story") add some fuel to the flames; however, Grande makes a concerted effort to maintain focus on personal growth through introspection on tracks like the reflective "I Wish I Hated You" and "Don't Wanna Break Up Again," which humanize her into an everywoman promoting healthy self-care tactics like self-soothing and therapy. For those who had been expecting a full-on, house-influenced raver, an album packed with "Yes, And?" style bops won't be found here. Instead, Grande strikes a balance between the warm, lush R&B tones of Positions and Thank U, Next with the lighter, feel-good fare found on Sweetener. "Yes, And?" is indeed the energetic centerpiece of this album, a blissful dose of dancefloor magic that follows the "Express Yourself"/"Born This Way" lineage of ballroom-inspired empowerment anthems. Though not as buoyant, the shimmering "We Can't Be Friends (Wait for Your Love)" is a Robyn-esque slice of neon synths, twinkling production, and throbbing groove, which boosts the bittersweet vulnerability of her lyrics, while the sparkling kiss-off "Bye" keeps the disco revival train chugging along as Grande dances her woes away. Beyond that, Eternal Sunshine sticks close to impeccably produced midtempo songs that highlight her vocal range and the mountain of thoughts she has to get off her chest at such a pivotal stage in her life. It's anything but boring; rather, these tracks hypnotize (the reawakening of "Supernatural"), comfort ("Eternal Sunshine"), and nourish the soul like the titular rays of light ("Imperfect for You"). Closing with the horn-swelled "Ordinary Things," Grande calls on her grandmother Marjorie for some sweet, sage advice about making a relationship last, a touching bit of wisdom to frame the young artist's very adult breakup and the healing, however messy, that followed. After the late-2010s blitz that saw her conquering the charts on an annual basis with output of steadily decreasing quality, the years spent re-centering and growing up were clearly fruitful, resulting in one of her strongest, most cohesive efforts to date. Eternal Sunshine is Grande in peak form, a magical maturation that is elevated, resilient, and confidently restrained.© Neil Z. Yeung /TiVo	22	CD	2026-01-18 21:54:00.08307	2
436479	Sweetener (Explicit)	Ariana Grande	72.67	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/kb/y4/q7kep4b3oy4kb_600.jpg	qobuz:52579470|q7kep4b3oy4kb	With her second album My Everything, Ariana Grande already made a clean sweep of awards in 2014. Four years later, now 25 years old, she seems more comfortable than ever on Sweetener, a multi-textured pop album. The young woman, who had a tendency to lose herself in weeping lyrical musings, has found a new path on which she’s able to lay out her strong personality. Behind her angelic face hides a fierce predator, capable of venturing onto risky territories. She doesn’t appear unfazed by Pharrell Williams on their retro 90’s duo Blazed. Ariana Grande knows how to take her rightful place, even with the queen Nicki Minaj, who confronted her in a hip-hop test (The Light Is Coming). With REM and God Is a Woman, there is no longer any doubt. The young singer blurs boundaries and expands her musical field to the point of embodying a goddess. But the charm of Ariana Grande is the ease and humility with which she plays with her various facets. Kitsch and romantic, intense and funny, Sweetener is without a doubt the album that resembles her the most, by its fantasy, and the fact that she composed ten out of the fifteen tracks or so. As a confirmed singer-songwriter, Grande now joins the next level with a solid album, but not as experimental and scattered as her previous ones. © Anna Coluthe/Qobuz	29	CD	2026-01-18 21:54:00.083074	2

Possessed with greater vocal chops than any of her peers -- her effortless runs revealed the limitations of Katy Perry and Rihanna -- she luxuriated in her debt to Mariah Carey on her 2013 debut Yours Truly, working mainly with Babyface to re-create the vibe and feel of the '90s. On My Everything, Grande takes a decisive step into the future, breaking away from Babyface so she can bring in a host of modern producers -- Max Martin, Shellback, David Guetta, Benny Blanco, Ryan Tedder, Darkchild, and Pop & Oak among them -- not to mention a parade of guest stars highlighted by Iggy Azalea, A$AP Ferg, the Weeknd, Childish Gambino, Zedd, and Big Sean. All this suggests Grande is resolved to inhabit her time, which is true. She remains anchored in '90s soul on My Everything -- and it's hard to deny her love of Mariah, although Ariana rarely indulges in the high-flying melisma that's her idol's specialty -- but there are serious EDM flourishes and a facility with hip-hop, something that's showcased via the countless cameos that eat up the midsection of the album. With the exception of Iggy swooping in on "Problem" or the Weeknd on "Love Me Harder," these cameos are often used as flair -- not dissimilar to the washes of analog synths, the "I'm Coming Out" sample on "Break Your Heart Right Back," or stuttering EDM beats -- on songs that keep the focus on the melodies Grande delivers with exacting grace. Ultimately, this emphasis on song is to the benefit of My Everything. Perhaps Grande doesn't overwhelm the songs the way an old-fashioned diva would, but she functions as a likeable pop ringleader, stepping aside when the track calls for it and then unleashing a full-throated wail when it's her time to shine.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	37	CD	2026-01-18 21:54:00.083076	2
485004	Positions (Explicit)	Ariana Grande	86.3	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/0a/cg/krlyad6a3cg0a_600.jpg	qobuz:104613496|krlyad6a3cg0a	In 2019, we left America’s darling, Ariana Grande, in mourning after the death of her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller. Her album thank u, next was the first glimpse at her attempt to rebuild herself and its success confirmed her place as today’s leading pop star. On positions, we witness a woman that is beginning to overcome her grief. An artist who has long since swapped the image of a vulnerable singer with one an image that is stronger and overall, more optimistic. Her long-time producer and friend Tommy Brown, aka TBHits, worked on the album. It was Brown who encouraged her to explore new sounds that are still within the realms of pop but are more electronic and synthetic, like on motive (featuring Doja Cat), in which English influences are more prominent. Another big difference is the unbridled, explicit sensuality that can be heard on tracks like 34+35 (if you add the two numbers together, you get 69). She sings, "Can you stay up all night? / F*ck me 'til the daylight? / Thirty-four, thirty-five” and likewise on nasty, "Don't wanna wait on it / Tonight, I wanna get nasty”. Well, the message is certainly crystal clear. But positions, whose name is perhaps more ambiguous at first glance, is not just limited to that. It also falls within the candy-coated pop classicism genre, notably with off the table (featuring The Weeknd), which gives the impression she’s still working on herself from the line, “Will I ever love the same way again?”. Or on my hair, which showcases her ultrasound voice range in the middle of a track-list that doesn’t tend to flaunt her vocal techniques as much. Ariana Grande is no longer America’s darling little girl. She has become so much more, and she’s all the better for it. © Brice Miclet/Qobuz	8	CD	2026-01-18 21:54:00.083077	2

She shrugged that her second album offered more of the same (Here We Go Again), she bounced back whole from a turbulent spell (Unbroken), then she found a new mature identity (Demi) and, now on her fifth album, she's all about being Confident. Deservedly so, too, because this 2015 album is Lovato's best all-around record since her 2008 debut, Don't Forget. Confident is steely, assured dance and shimmering electro-pop, as much a reflection of its time as the sugary blast of Radio Disney pop on Don't Forget. If that debut seemed somewhat driven by producers, Confident feels directed by Lovato, who seems to take some pride in being a bit of a pop magpie, sampling from every glittering sound flickering across the pop charts in the two years since Demi. She's fortunate to be aided by some of the best producers and writers in the business. Max Martin collaborates on three tracks, the same number as Steve Mac, with Stargate and Ryan Tedder showing up elsewhere, and while their work helps Lovato echo everyone from Katy Perry to Beyoncé, it never quite seems like the singer is mimicking her fellow divas: instead, she's carving out her persona -- something sexy, flinty, and impassioned, the stance of a survivor, not a carpetbagger -- through the best of what's around. Given this boldness, it's little surprise that Demi often fares best with the numbers that are brassy: the big, heavy swing of the title track, the same-sex seduction of "Cool for the Summer," the empowering "For You" and "Lionheart," the latter a gleaming wall of sound. When the tempo slows, Lovato can sometimes stumble -- "Father" is spare and skeletal but indistinct, a sketch that is nevertheless preferable to the shoehorned Iggy Azalea cameo on "Kingdom Come" -- yet here, she also illustrates how she can affect Lana Del Rey's affectless effect and conjure some of the lushness of Ellie Goulding's neon-streaked midnight anthems, so when these ballads are added to the brighter, swifter numbers, the cumulative result is a messy, colorful modern pop record that is greater than the sum of its parts.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	39	CD	2026-01-18 21:54:35.713831	2

As the character Cat Valentine on several Nickelodeon television shows including I Carly, Victorious, and Sam & Cat, Grande developed a huge fan following and the expectations were high for her debut album. Three years in the making and held up by numerous delays, Yours Truly lives up to those expectations. Produced by Kenneth "Babyface" Edmonds, Yours Truly is an impeccably engineered affair. In fact, one would be hard-pressed to find a better platform for Grande's voice. A resonant singer gifted with a lithe affinity for both high-energy melisma and gentle balladry, Grande often brings to mind the intonations of Mariah Carey. Of course, with Edmonds at the helm, along with a bevy of commercially minded songwriters, the Carey comparisons are unavoidable and most likely intentional. Thankfully, Grande has the chops to pull it off, and Yours Truly makes the most of her talent. To these ends, tracks like the opening "Honeymoon Avenue," with its sophisticated orchestral intro, and the bright and funky "You'll Never Know" sound like lost early-'90s R&B hits. Though Grande has the talent to carry the album on her own steam, several tracks team her with guest performers, including the single "The Way," which features rapper Mac Miller; "Right There" with Big Sean; and "Popular Song," featuring Mika. Ultimately, cuts like "Baby I" and the jazz-inflected showstopper "Almost Is Never Enough," featuring the Wanted's Nathan Sykes, are bravura pop recordings that bring to mind the best of the '90s and of now. © Matt Collar /TiVo	32	CD	2026-01-18 21:54:00.083079	2

She wanted to release singles and albums as quickly as she recorded them, a modus operandi that seemed sensible when she delivered an album as vibrant as thank u, next, but when the album is as monochromatic as its swift sequel Positions, it's questionable. Grande designed Positions as mood music -- specifically, it's a soundtrack for long nights of sex. None of the glitz of "7 Rings" can be heard here, nor is there a sense of mischief. Positions is single-minded in its pursuit of carnality, an album devoted to Grande singing dirty over elastic, erotic slow jams. Her lyrics are often explicit, causing a slight tension with her vocals, which are always controlled and very rarely given to moments of sensuality; she never seems quite as carnal as the words she's singing. This cool, reserved vibe doesn't necessarily sabotage Grande's intent, as it does help maintain the mood. Such an intense, sustained focus does mean Positions succeeds in sounding sexy, but it doesn't do much outside of that: apart from the title track, few songs stand out individually, the rhythm and productions are all painted in shades of grey, and Grande disappears into the setting of her own design. Maybe this is the entire point of Positions -- it's meant to be sex music, nothing more, nothing less -- but the swift succession of albums suggests that Grande may be better off slowing her creative process down just enough to help sculpt the album into a soundtrack that has an ebb and flow instead of a single sustained thrum.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	17	CD	2026-01-18 21:54:00.08308	2

957978	CRASH	Charli XCX	318.07	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/nc/7w/mtc07vucc7wnc_600.jpg	qobuz:136914750|mtc07vucc7wnc	Reported to be her final album for Atlantic at the time of its release, Charli XCX embraces the idea of being a major-label pop artist to the fullest on Crash. For her, going mainstream is something of a daring move. Her previous album, 2020's Mercury Prize-longlisted how i'm feeling now, was one of her most experimental releases, its heartbroken hyperpop capturing the feeling of bouncing off the walls during the COVID-19 quarantine. That album (and her mixtapes) made a strong case for her more spontaneous releases being among her best, but the craft she applies to Crash isn't overdone. This is truly poptimist pop that consciously reframes the genre's past heyday as worthy of celebrating and updating. XCX grounds the album in the styles of the late '80s and early '90s and the late '90s and early 2000s -- eras when pop was highly produced but also highly creative. It's an aesthetic that suits Charli XCX well, especially on the bright, New Jack-jacking moves of "New Shapes," which features Caroline Polachek and Christine and the Queens, two other experts at giving a fresh context to vintage pop. On "Yuck," a charmingly disgusted rejection of lovey-dovey infatuation, XCX creates the perfect pastiche of late-'80s sounds, but she gets more literal on "Used to Know Me," which samples Robin S.'s 1993 earworm "Show Me Love"; on "Beg for You," a collaboration with Rina Sawayama, she folds in the massive hits "Cry for You" by September and "Don't Cry" by Milk Inc. Putting a boundary-pushing artist like Sawayama on one of Crash's most overtly retro songs feels like a missed opportunity, but "Beg for You"'s pulsing desperation is still a highlight that shows just how baked into pop's collective memory these decades-old songs still are. As she pays homage to pop music's past, XCX also borrows from her own. The way Crash takes inspiration from David Cronenberg's film of the same name echoes how she alluded to Quentin Tarantino's True Romance on her debut album, and the percolating death wish of the title track continues the car motif winding through her work since Icona Pop's "I Love It." The tweaked vocals on the slow-motion ballad "Move Me" recall the Charli highlight "Cross You Out," while "Good Ones" combines the self-defeating heartache that's been a key theme since her early days with the hooky songwriting that she's transformed into hits for others. Among all these revisitations of the past, Crash's concision feels new. On her other albums, XCX occasionally included so many songs that the great songs had to compete with the good ones for attention. At a sleek 33-minutes long, Crash lets songs like "Lightning" -- an unlikely but winning collision of freestyle beats, giddy orchestral synth stabs, and processed vocals -- claim the spotlight they deserve. It may not be quite as striking as how i'm feeling now, but on Crash, Charli XCX once again finds endless freedom in pop's constraints.© Heather Phares /TiVo	18	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:49.457494	1
834401	WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO?	Billie Eilish	85.77	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/gc/eh/wo456u01fehgc_600.jpg	qobuz:77469834|wo456u01fehgc	“We are not serious when we are 17.” But Billie Eilish has all the marks of a serious young lady and someone who we should indeed take seriously. At the age of sixteen she released the noteworthy Don’t Smile at Me, an EP created with the help of her older brother, Finneas O’Connell. The EP is comprised of the singles Copycat, Bellyache and Ocean Eyes and was posted two years earlier on Soundcloud when Eilish was just 14 years old. Critics hailed her music due to its depiction of a lost adolescent with bleached hair, dressed in oversized sweaters. With the album When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? and its strange title and shocking cover, Eilish and her dark hair flaunt their more obscure side. One is immediately struck with how well polished Finneas O’Connell’s production is after an intro in which Eilish jokingly mocks her brother for his Invisalign (a kind of invisible dental brace). The first track Bad Guy features an EDM beat which contrasts with the dreaminess of the subsequent Xanny. The rest of the album follows this trend, weaving together both harsh and soft songs combined with the mature lyrics of a girl who was diagnosed with Tourette’s at the age of 11 and speaks of Xanax and young girls descent into a hellish existence. In this mix of gloomy pop and creepy trap beats, Eilish excels. A real eye-opener. © Charlotte Saintoin/Qobuz	29	CD	2026-01-18 21:54:04.8998	2
972441	HIT ME HARD AND SOFT	Billie Eilish	51.59	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/kc/95/gvcirtodd95kc_600.jpg	qobuz:266725026|gvcirtodd95kc	Billie Eilish gives away the sonic theme of her third album right in the title. She and brother Finneas, serving once again as producer and co-writer, are in a mood to play with dynamics. She sounds great and beyond her 22 years on "L'AMOUR DE MA VIE," stepping out of the whisper zone that pervades much of the record. It starts out as a jazzy little ditty then takes a hard left turn: thumping EDM rave beat, buzzy synth, Auto-Tune vocals. "BITTERSUITE" begins as a loungey reggae romp then does a presto-chango with John Carpenter-esque spooky synth. And the monster shift of "THE GREATEST," from melancholy acoustic track to shoot-for-the-stars power ballad, recalls the excellent switcheroo of 2021's "Happier Than Ever"—only this time, Eilish isn't acting out with blood-and-guts grunge; it's more about controlled emotion, and it's impressive. The song explores the pain of realizing you love more than you're loved back, and the hide-behind-sarcasm chorus is a wallop. "All the times I waited/ For you to want me naked/ Made it all look painless," Eilish sings, practically rolling her eyes through words—before it erupts: "Man, am I the greatest." The singer's self-deprecating humor is sharp as ever, like when she sings on "L'AMOUR DE MA VIE" about how love can be blinding, but the fall of heartbreak restores your vision and sanity: "You said you'd never fall in love again because of me/ Then you moved on"—you can hear her slight chuckle here—"immediately." She follows up the line with "Bum, bum, bum," like she's her own punchline rimshot. "SKINNY" was written while Eilish was working on her 2023 hit "What Was I Made For?" from the Barbie movie, and the two have plenty in common—Billie at her breathiest and most vulnerable. "People say I look happy/ Just because I got skinny/ But the old me is still me and maybe the real me/ And I think she's pretty," she sings, offering a look into the trappings of fame in the modern age. "When I step off the stage, I'm a bird in a cage … And the internet is hungry for the meanest kinda funny/ And somebody's gotta feed it." But there's plenty of fun here, too. Bass-heavy "Lunch," which acknowledges the singer being newly out about her sexuality, feels like a cousin to her breakthrough "Bad Guy"; the song coyly slithers, but wolfish Eilish is straightforward, panting "I could eat that girl for lunch" over goth synth. "Birds of a Feather" is a giddy nod to mid-'80s radio pop. "CHIHIRO"—named for the hero of the Hayao Miyazaki movie Spirited Away—has an elastic, trance-like '90s vibe. And slinky "THE DINER" dips into French-kissed Romany pop. It all ends with "BLUE," which travels from moody pop to stark ballad to cool, robo-effect hip-hop and drops lyrical Easter eggs that seem to reference the album's other songs before Eilish acknowledges the world's insatiability: "Now when can I hear the next one?" © Shelly Ridenour/Qobuz	14	CD	2026-01-18 21:54:04.899805	2

Having shot to international superstardom with When We All Fall Asleep, Where Do We Go? and having already taken five Grammy Awards, Billie Eilish has flipped the script without changing the fundamentals. Her tortured dark pop has evolved with the ironically-titled Happier Than Ever. "Almost none of the songs on this album are joyful", she points out. Take the cover, where she poses as Our Lady of Sorrows, this gifted but tearful icon chooses to clothe yesterday's sorrows in soft and voluptuous pop sounds. Where the last album was all about nightmarish fiction, this more intimate work takes a realist turn. Very eclectic musically, sometimes vintage, sometimes futuristic, its sixteen tracks rack up one surprise after another: Billie is never where you expect her to be.The sequences are carefully worked-out. Eilish oscillates between slow tempos (Getting Older, Billie bossa nova) and haunting EDM beats on Oxytocin – the hormone of love – or minimalist sounds (as on OverHeated), making for an amazing mix of genres. Thus, among Grimes-like syncopated choruses (GOLDWING), autotuned R'N'B (NDA) in the style of 070 Shake, folk ballads (Halley's Comet) and spartan soundscapes (Not My Responsibility), she manages to slip in the guitar-vocals number "Your Power", an emotional peak on which she speaks about suffering abuse. Accompanied by her brother, Finneas O'Connell, an enjoying a slick production job, Billie Eilish has created a masterful record which she hoped would prove timeless. That ambition is easy to understand when she mentions Frank Sinatra, Antonio Carlos Jobim and Julie London as influences. "It was the most enriching and deepest experience I have ever had with my music," she says. Fortunately, at just 19, there are likely to be many more. © Charlotte Saintoin / Qobuz	7	CD	2026-01-18 21:54:04.899805	2

Produced and co-written by Eilish's older brother, Finneas O'Connell, the eight-track release features the lush and lonesome single "Ocean Eyes," a song that first went viral for the Los Angeles-based artist in 2016 and brought her to the attention of Interscope. Eilish's sound is sleek, sometimes quirky, and often characterized by clever wordplay. Subsequent singles "watch" and "COPYCAT" were issued in the summer of 2017 in advance of the EP's release.© Timothy Monger /TiVo	39	CD	2026-01-18 21:54:04.899805	2

Maturity is a bit of a tricky business on Demi, as it finds them copping modern trends without quite shaking off the studio system that fostered them. The latter is problematic, resulting in half-baked exercises in pageantry -- such as the "Skyscraper" rewrite "Nightingale" -- and the occasional cultural dissonance, like when they tell a suitor "you try to take me home like you're DiMaggio," a name not heard in a pop song for almost 25 years. Unfortunately, a lot of these stumbles arrive early in the record, but the back half of Demi shifts into a place where the studio professionalism and blatant cash-ins click. They bring in Cher Lloyd, from the seventh season of the British X-Factor, to rap on the brightly brickwalled kiss-off "Really Don't Care," they skip through the wildly appealing "Something That We're Not" -- quite easily the purest and best piece of pop here -- and deliriously rip off Katy Perry's "Firework" on "Fire Starter," which is shameless in its appropriation of the prior hit's construction and progression, but not its attitude. This second half is strong enough to make some of the earlier, tentative moments seem a bit better -- this is particularly true of "Made in the USA," which cops Miley's "Party in the USA," but it's not quite so fetching an exploitation as "Fire Starter" -- but ultimately, this isn't an album of purpose, it's a collection of moments, and it has just enough good ones to solidify Demi Lovato's comeback.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	35	CD	2026-01-18 21:54:35.713835	2

Lovato intended the juxtaposition to highlight the album's heavy modern R&B influence, but the two records also share a candid carnality that sometimes feels a bit too blunt. It's not just that Lovato can't resist peppering their lyrics with profanity -- the album is littered with conjugations of "f***," arriving on both ballads and uptempo cuts -- but they dispense with niceties throughout the record, imploring a mate they should "Ruin the Friendship" and slide into bed, or telling a new love that "lucky for you, I've got all these daddy issues." Subtle the words are not, and while the music occasionally matches this braggadocio -- "Daddy Issues" blusters with its stuttering synth drops -- on the whole, Tell Me You Love Me is subtler musically. Lovato's assertions that Tell Me You Love Me is steeped in R&B prove true, and it's not monochromatic soul, either. Opening with the strutting empowerment anthem "Sorry Not Sorry," the album runs the gamut from churchy soul to seductive slow-burners to showstopping ballads designed to showcase every single one of Lovato's moves. Although there are ghosts of traditional soul threaded through the record, the production is firmly modern, filled with electronic flair and allusions to hip-hop rhythms. It's a sound that suits Lovato, who has never positioned themself as a retro-soul singer but has repurposed older sounds for a fresh audience. They've usually done this with a pop bent, but with its cool surface, sharply constructed songs, and Lovato's controlled performances -- all elements that more than make up for their lyrical stumbles -- Tell Me You Love Me suggests soul may be their forte.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	22	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:54:46.46826	1
378321	HOLY FVCK	Demi Lovato	49.4	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/ca/7g/b927v0iwv7gca_600.jpg	qobuz:169700371|b927v0iwv7gca	Holy Fvck is an absolute blast. True to the title, the most natural response to this stylistic pivot from erstwhile pop star Demi Lovato is one of shock and pleasant surprise. After years of headlines threatened to overshadow their musical output, it might be easy for detractors to be cynical about Lovato riding the pop-punk resurgence of the early 2020s. But Holy Fvck is so much more than trend-chasing: it manages to sound more authentic than anything they've done to date. Pissed off and throwing care to the wind, Lovato fully embraces this rebirth through jagged riffs and sticky leather, tackling gossip, trauma, mortality, and addiction with a snarl and a fist. Addressing critics and detractors, Lovato declares, "I came from the trauma/Stayed for the drama" on the lurching Flyleaf-esque opener "Freak" with fellow punk revivalist Yungblud. That "f*ck it" attitude pummels listeners on cuts like the raunchy "City of Angels," a quotable ode to reckless sex that channels Avril Lavigne-style pop-punk, and "Skin of My Teeth," an open confessional of their struggles with rehab and addiction that slaps together Celebrity Skin-era Hole, a shiny pop chorus, and a robotic Lady Gaga-stylized vocal bridge. That unflinching honesty abounds from start to finish, both in the form of frustrated kiss-offs (like the metalcore-meets-Muse attack of "Eat Me" with Royal & the Serpent) and raw reflection, with death looming over tracks such as the reflective "Happy Ending," which recounts their 2018 overdose, and "Dead Friends," which laments those who succumbed to their addictions. The most attention-grabbing moment arrives on "29," a scathing takedown of a past relationship with eye-popping lyrics like "Too young to drink wine/Just five years a bleeder." While much has been made about a "return to form" in the vein of early albums Don't Forget (2008) and Here We Go Again (2009), Holy Fvck rockets way beyond those relatively innocent pop-rock teen moments. "Heaven" stomps and pogos with glam scuzz bounce, while the turbulent "Bones" and Halestorm-sized "Help Me" propel the latter half of the album with driving rock sleaze courtesy of Los Angeles trio Dead Sara. For fans in search of less raucous material, Lovato pushes their vocals to the rafters with soaring midtempo power rock ballads such as "Wasted," "Come Together," "Feed," and "4 Ever 4 Me," rousing singalongs that could easily fit on a Kelly Clarkson or P!nk album. In the face of doubt and criticism, Lovato nails this drastic image shift. Whether it's a genuine transformation or just a brief exercise for the pop chameleon, the triumphant Holy Fvck is a refreshing change of pace and an utter thrill to experience for those willing to look past the headlines into the heart of an artist who continues to grow in the public eye.© Neil Z.

Where the series focused on the past, the album, as its title suggests, is a bit of a rebirth, where Lovato is looking forward to a new phase in their career -- not that Lovato has taken their trauma off the table entirely. The first stretch of The Art of Starting Over tackles their 2018 relapse and subsequent hospitalization, while much of the rest of the record is so bluntly confessional it can play like a journal. Often, this blend of candid soul-baring and hyper-stylized pop can cause a bit of cognitive dissonance; the songs seem built to support emotions a bit frothier than what the lyrics detail. Lovato's frankness is disarming, forcing the listener to reckon with the depths of the singer's distinction, yet the album works best when it veers toward lighter territory, letting the slick R&B rhythms and sugared hooks carry Lovato's emoting.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	30	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:54:46.468264	1
684659	Unbroken	Demi Lovato	43.66	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/lc/4a/f31lxny964alc_600.jpg	qobuz:57119409|f31lxny964alc	Breaking into a whirlwind schedule of filming Disney TV movies and touring the world with the Jonas Brothers, Demi Lovato checked into a treatment facility in the fall of 2010. Denying rumors of substance abuse, including allegations that she snorted cocaine “like a pro,” her management team confessed that Lovato was being treated for emotional issues that manifested themselves in bulimia and cutting, serious matters that can’t be swept under the rug, so Lovato attempts to clear the air via her post-treatment record, 2011’s Unbroken. Clearly, the title is intended to convey strength, while its lead single, “Skyscraper,” conveyed vulnerability, setting a precedent for Lovato specifically addressing her problems on “Fix a Heart,” where she runs out of Band-Aids to bind her wounds. All admirable attempts at honesty, yet these confessionals bear an uncomfortable resemblance to Lindsay Lohan’s autobiographical A Little More Personal (Raw), particularly when Lovato concludes the record with “For the Love of a Daughter,” its pained chorus echoing the sentiments of “Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father).” If Unbroken contained nothing but confessions it’d be an odd but possibly effective way to address her troubles. Instead, these stark ballads -- which Lovato doesn’t quite have the pipes to sing without straining -- are paired with a half-album's worth of songs that act like nothing is wrong in Demi’s world at all, that she can keep partying “All Night Long” and shaking her hips for her only shorty. Ryan Tedder attempts to push her onto the charts while Timbaland knocks off his own production of Nelly Furtado’s “Promiscuous,” the frivolity clashing with introspection, the presence of both undermining the substance of either. It’s hard to party knowing Lovato couldn’t quite handle the clubs, while it’s not easy to trust the melancholy flowing through the ballads knowing she’s ready to cut loose. One of these personas is an act, the question is which one.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	11	CD	2026-01-18 21:54:46.468265	2

Lovato appeared in the Disney TV movie Rock Camp with the Brothers and toured with them prior to the release of Don't Forget, but the more crucial connection between the two camps is revealed in the album's credits: six of the 11 songs here were co-written by the Jonas Brothers. Given this, it shouldn't come as a great surprise that Demi's music sounds a lot like the Brothers: it's bright, sugary, snappy power pop, fueled by big, fuzzy guitars and big, muscular hooks. Unlike the Brothers' 2008 album, A Little Bit Longer, there is no attempt to sell Demi Lovato to an audience broader than tweens, so this is pure, unapologetic bubblegum, a fizzy rush of singalong hooks occasionally punctuated by a bit of sighing puppy love, which surfaces most strongly on "On the Line," an actual duet with the Jonas Brothers. This is fine fodder for a middle school slow dance, but what's really memorable about Don't Forget is its parade of urgent, insistent guitar pop -- the kind of pop that feels disposable but winds up sticking around longer than its more considered cousins. This kind of trashy fun was missing on A Little Bit Longer, so it's nice to find that it surfaces proudly on Don't Forget. It's pure pop for tween people.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	26	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:54:46.468265	1

As straightforward as that sounds, Lovato slaps some leather and eyeliner on a range of favorites culled from 2008's debut Don't Forget through 2017's Tell Me You Love Me. While the already-rocking "Don't Forget" didn't really need a remake, Lovato's updated vocal performance does make the track even more powerful. The rest of Revamped is more daring, as they dabble in punk rock ("Heart Attack"), metalcore ("Cool for the Summer"), stadium rock ("Tell Me You Love Me," "Skyscraper"), and old-fashioned rock & roll ("La La Land" with touring guitarist Nita Strauss). The chaotic "Neon Lights" with the Maine, the glam rock stompers "Confident" and "Sorry Not Sorry" with Slash, and a soaring duet with the Used's Bert McCracken ("Give Your Heart a Break") round out this rousing set, which could just as well be called "Greatest Hits (Demi's Version)." Revamped is great fun, and fans of both sides of Lovato's sonic personality will appreciate this bonus diversion from the main catalog.© Neil Z. Yeung /TiVo	32	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:54:46.468266	1

For Here We Go Again, Lovato makes a relatively clean break from the Jonas Brothers, who penned much of their debut Don't Forget, drafting sensitive AAA singer/songwriters Jon McLaughlin and John Mayer presumably to give Lovato a bit of mature veneer, a subtle shift buried underneath the relentlessly cheerful Radio Disney production and Lovato's irrepressible spunk. Both sonic characteristics tend to camouflage Demi's biggest moves away from teen pop -- the fussy balladeering of "Falling Over Me," the mock-Mraz jazz-pop "Every Time You Lie," the sober soul searching of the Mayer collaboration "World of Chances," the Celtic flair of "Gift of a Friend" -- which also happen to be the very things that make Here We Go Again not quite as much fizzy fun as Don't Forget. There's still some fun to be had, though, particularly when Lovato tears into hooky power pop like "Here We Go Again," "Solo," "Remember December," and the stomping "So Far So Great," the theme song to the TV show Sonny with a Chance, songs that are ideally matched to Lovato's adolescent energy and spirit, which remain their most appealing qualities.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	20	CD	2026-01-18 21:54:46.468268	2

Two years later, Badlands finds the 20-year-old budding pop sensation delivering a set of songs that sound a lot like that fateful first single. Which isn't a bad thing. The sound that defined their D.I.Y. music is still apparent, though they did collaborate here with a handful of like-minded producers including Lido, the Futuristics, and Son Lux, who helped flesh out their highly personal songs into even more dramatic, sonically dense recordings. On the surface, Badlands is all chilly atmosphere, thanks to a bevy of thick bass tones, pulsing synthesizers, and rattlesnake percussion loops. It's a goth throwback that brings to mind Danny Lohner's work with Nine Inch Nails. However, underneath that icy landscape, Halsey burns with a feminist confidence, spitting out lyrics with their soulful voice that sounds like Björk with vocal fry. On "Castle," they sing "I'm headed straight for the castle/They've got the kingdom locked up/And there's an old man sitting on a throne they're saying, 'I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut.'" Of course, it's clear from the start of Badlands that keeping their mouth shut is the last thing Halsey plans to do. As they proclaim on the taut, slow-tempo jam "Hold Me Down," "My demons are begging me to open up my mouth." Thankfully, Halsey consistently brings a strong sense of self to their content at every turn, musing with blithe emotion about their sexuality and creative independence. They also have a knack for singling out little generational touchstones that lend their songs an anthemic quality. On "New Americana," their vocals double-tracked like the children's chorus on Pink Floyd's "Another Brick in the Wall," they sing, "We are the new Americana/High on legal marijuana/Raised on Biggie and Nirvana." Interestingly, while their noir-ish, older-than-their-years image has drawn comparisons to contemporaries like Lana Del Rey and Lorde (and yes, there are similarities) musically, they have more in common with male-fronted acts like New York's X Ambassadors, merging dark, electronic indie with the rhythmic bump and lyrical flow of R&B. There's also something angry, literate, and youthfully defiant about Badlands that brings to mind the sneer of Garbage's Shirley Manson. Ultimately, it's all of Halsey's seemingly contradictory elements brought together that lend Badlands such a fascinating topography.© Matt Collar /TiVo	23	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:54:49.743266	1
189469	Manic	Halsey	156.99	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/9a/gt/egoyz66cegt9a_600.jpg	qobuz:102368053|egoyz66cegt9a	As they were in the throes of completing their third studio album in 2019, Halsey told Rolling Stone the record would contain "hip-hop, rock, country, f***ing everything because it's so manic. It's soooooo manic." It was so manic, Halsey decided Manic was the right title for this high-profile album, the first they've released since 2017's Hopeless Fountain Kingdom helped turn them into a regular presence at the top of the charts. As it turns out, Manic is indeed an appropriate name for an album so filled with twists and turns it feels like a double-LP crammed into the course of a 47-minute record. Such a description is slightly misleading, though, suggesting that the album contains a series of distinct shifts in mood when it is very much a record of its moment, thrumming along to the tasteful shape-shifting hybrids that populate playlists of all genres. Listen closely, certain stylistic aspects assert themselves -- a fingerpicked guitar line rolls along here, there's a reggae bounce there -- and their choice of guest stars is telling. Alanis Morissette -- who is by some measures a clear precursor to Halsey -- vies with rapper Dominic Fike and Suga of K-pop sensations BTS for the splashiest cameo, with each of their appearances labeled as an "interlude." The lack of concrete song titles winds up emphasizing the presence of artists who cross genres, a clear sign of how Manic's seemingly scattershot appearance disguises that Halsey designed the album to appeal to as broad an audience as possible, streamlining all these sounds so they slide onto every conceivable playlist. It's a shrewd ploy that winds up not seeming crass thanks to Halsey's affectless emo bloodletting -- she never resists an opportunity to hit their target squarely on the nose, such as the "I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you" refrain on "You Should Be Sad" -- and the clever way Manic is sequenced. The artiest, wobbliest songs start the record, followed by their saddest and starkest ballads, so it takes a while before it settles into its comfortable groove of adolescent angst doubling as AAA crossover pop. Such distinctions would be lost on the playlists individual tracks may later call home, but assembled in this fashion as a proper album, Manic showcases Halsey at their nerviest and at their best.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	30	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:54:49.74327	1
185748	The Great Impersonator	Halsey	67.19	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/9b/nu/itwwq0om9nu9b_600.jpg	qobuz:296177311|itwwq0om9nu9b	For their fifth album, Halsey (who uses she/they pronouns) gets intensely personal while paying tribute to some of their major influences. "Letter to God (1983)" is just one harrowing track relating to suffering from lupus, a T-cell disorder, endometriosis, Sjogren's syndrome and at least three other medical conditions. "I'm at the doctor's every day/ Because I can't stop losing weight/ And now I'm the one/ With needles in my arms and in my legs… And I'm planning my estate," she sings after an intro that borrows from Bruce Springsteen's "I'm On Fire." Performed live, its chorus almost like a prayer. Halsey exposes their life in a way that proves that, next to Chappell Roan, she is the most honest, transparent songwriter in pop right now. On moody and dark "Dog Years," she ties together the death of her dog with thoughts about her own mortality. Halsey whisper-growls ominously, inspired by PJ Harvey; but it also brings to mind the seminal "Joe Lies" from the movie Say Anything (sung by Lili Taylor). Tori Amos is the influence for "Life Of The Spider (Draft)," a raw live recording of a pained piano ballad that finds Halsey singing in a more emotive style—their anguished vocals reaching a breaking point on lyrics like "I should be getting better, but I'm only getting worse." Other somber ballads are callbacks to David Bowie ("Darwinism,") Linda Rondstadt ("I Believe In Magic," featuring the babbles of Halsey's young son) and Joni Mitchell ("The End"). But it's not all musical downers. "Panic Attack" officially plays with the late 1970s AOR of Stevie Nicks, though you can hear a little Sheryl Crow in the chorus. Mandolin brightens up the breezy country jangle of "Hometown," a nod to Dolly Parton, and Halsey employs a classic hip-hop drum beat on the Fiona Apple-esque "Arsonist." Sometimes, she even rocks out: "Lonely Is The Muse" with a hushed whisper and atonal guitar effect inspired by Evanescence's Amy Lee, kicks in to a big goth-emo chorus, and the Cranberries-fueled "Ego" escalates to a stomping crunch (softened by background coos that draw directly from Dolores O'Riordan). Heartbreaking "Lucky" interpolates a Britney Spears song of the same name, with Halsey laughing through the pain of dealing with the comments of online trolls. "Only Living Girl In LA" similarly finds them chuckling at the macabre as she struggles with fame and their health—influenced by Marilyn Monroe, who Halsey has said "had to impersonate herself day after day." All in all, The Great Impersonator is an intriguing experiment in both its high concept and laid-bare honesty. © Shelly Ridenour/Qobuz	8	CD	2026-01-18 21:55:02.952123	2

The time is right for a great leap forward. Badlands, their 2014 debut, established Halsey as a possible contender for Lorde's brooding throne, but they received their breakthrough singing on the Chainsmokers' smash 2016 single "Closer." Both events inform Hopeless Fountain Kingdom, which casts a far wider net than Badlands. Where that album essentially dedicates itself to EDM-inspired pop, Hopeless Fountain Kingdom uses that sound as an anchor that allows Halsey to dip their toe into stark singer/songwriter confessions ("Sorry"), hip-hop ("Lie," featuring a verse by Quavo of Migos), soul ("Alone"), and a healthy dose of pop songs designed for mass exposure. It's a slight shift, but it's notable particularly because it helps differentiate the songs from one another. This doesn't always happen -- the first half of the record tends to bleed together into one pulsating neon smear -- but when the melodies are sharply articulated and the production not so cloistered, the tracks seem distinct, even memorable. "Alone," a foray into smooth soul, is chief among these cuts, rivaled by the soaring "Bad at Love" and "Strangers," where Halsey laments that their lover "doesn't kiss me on the mouth anymore." Same-sex love songs remain a rarity in the pop music of the 2010s, and while that's a sly reveal of how Halsey represents a generational shift, Hopeless Fountain Kingdom as a whole feels quintessentially 2017 in how it jumbles styles and sentiment, streamlining a teeming, contradictory culture into something smooth, glassy and easy to digest.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	25	CD	2026-01-18 21:55:02.952129	2
796787	Manic	Halsey	83.47	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/2a/2l/vwl9juiat2l2a_600.jpg	qobuz:84613804|vwl9juiat2l2a	As they were in the throes of completing their third studio album in 2019, Halsey told Rolling Stone the record would contain "hip-hop, rock, country, f***ing everything because it's so manic. It's soooooo manic." It was so manic, Halsey decided Manic was the right title for this high-profile album, the first they've released since 2017's Hopeless Fountain Kingdom helped turn them into a regular presence at the top of the charts. As it turns out, Manic is indeed an appropriate name for an album so filled with twists and turns it feels like a double-LP crammed into the course of a 47-minute record. Such a description is slightly misleading, though, suggesting that the album contains a series of distinct shifts in mood when it is very much a record of its moment, thrumming along to the tasteful shape-shifting hybrids that populate playlists of all genres. Listen closely, certain stylistic aspects assert themselves -- a fingerpicked guitar line rolls along here, there's a reggae bounce there -- and their choice of guest stars is telling. Alanis Morissette -- who is by some measures a clear precursor to Halsey -- vies with rapper Dominic Fike and Suga of K-pop sensations BTS for the splashiest cameo, with each of their appearances labeled as an "interlude." The lack of concrete song titles winds up emphasizing the presence of artists who cross genres, a clear sign of how Manic's seemingly scattershot appearance disguises that Halsey designed the album to appeal to as broad an audience as possible, streamlining all these sounds so they slide onto every conceivable playlist. It's a shrewd ploy that winds up not seeming crass thanks to Halsey's affectless emo bloodletting -- she never resists an opportunity to hit their target squarely on the nose, such as the "I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you" refrain on "You Should Be Sad" -- and the clever way Manic is sequenced. The artiest, wobbliest songs start the record, followed by their saddest and starkest ballads, so it takes a while before it settles into its comfortable groove of adolescent angst doubling as AAA crossover pop. Such distinctions would be lost on the playlists individual tracks may later call home, but assembled in this fashion as a proper album, Manic showcases Halsey at their nerviest and at their best.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	39	CD	2026-01-18 21:55:02.95213	2

Teaming with Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross, they pack a lifetime of emotions into a ticking time bomb of angst buffered by the Nine Inch Nails duo's unmistakable production, which deftly serves Halsey's whims and allows the artist to outshine not only them, but a team of famous faces from the NIN orbit. When the project was first announced, the combination of global-pop-star-plus-industrial-wizards seemed a bit incongruous. However, they've succeeded in bringing out the best in each other, with Reznor and Ross setting the stage for Halsey to finally indulge in her alternative rock side, and Halsey giving the guys an excuse to flex their mainstream pop fancies. If I Can't Have Love... isn't simply "Halsey singing over NIN songs," but rather a true artistic union, where familiar NIN touchstones -- ominous atmospherics, minor-key piano tinkling, techno glitches, and distorted riffs -- support Halsey's visceral explorations of pregnancy, childbirth, life, and death. Along the way, they delve into the sacred and profane, face mortality, and reconcile vulnerability and empowerment. No strangers to the darker side of the human experience, Reznor and Ross match the self-loathing, regret, and pain coursing through Halsey's soul with production that stirs tension, frustration, and rage. From the opening piano waltz "The Tradition" to the sparse guitar thrumming of the morbid ode to her daughter "Ya'aburnee" (an Arabic phrase meaning "You bury me," as in "I'll die first so I don't have to live without you"), it's clear that this is a purposefully un-pop version of Halsey. Delivering on the promise of the rock-leaning 2019 single "Nightmare" and the explosive collaboration with Bring Me the Horizon from the Birds of Prey soundtrack, "Experiment on Me," Halsey launches headfirst into pop-punk (the bouncy "Honey"), industrial (the thrillingly cacophonous "Easier Than Lying"), and distorted sludge (the gothic horror showcase "The Lighthouse," an engrossing tale featuring whispered vocals from Reznor). Additional standouts include "Girl Is a Gun," which features neon synths and bubble-pop beats courtesy of Meat Beat Manifesto's Jack Dangers, and "Bells in Santa Fe," a gorgeous showcase of Halsey's poetic lyricism, commanding vocals, and the studio sorcery of Reznor, Ross, and the Bug's Kevin Martin. The album's big moment lands toward the end with the enthralling showstopper "I Am Not a Woman, I'm a God," a throbbing culmination of the core trio's power as a sonic unit. Throughout, Halsey maintains full control of this cinematic concept album, reducing all-stars such as Lindsey Buckingham (on the "Landslide"-esque acoustic break "Darling"), Dave Grohl ("Honey"), Pino Palladino and Kerriem Riggins (on the rhythmic "Lilith"), and Dave Sitek (on the '90s alt rock affair "You Asked for This") to mere studio hands. With Reznor and Ross supporting such a weighty artistic vision, Halsey takes a huge leap forward with this course-changing opus, a revelation that finally presents their most authentic representation of self.© Neil Z.

Likewise, the songs are shape-shifting and surprising, both musically and lyrically. When "The Tradition" starts out with medieval fairy-tale piano, it seems obvious that the song will explode into fireworks—but it never does, and it's just the first example of producers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross' fascinating subtlety. The song's most dramatic dynamic shift is the addition of lower-register keys as Halsey snarl-chants what could be taken as a cry of empowerment or a threat: "Take what you want/ Take what you can/ Take what you please/ Don't give a damn/ Ask for forgiveness, never permission." It's not all musical restraint, though. The terrific "Easier Than Lying" contrasts Halsey's sweet voice against a jagged-edge melody before erupting into a gratifying, Paramore-style emo chorus. There's a similar feel to the pogo-bounce—fueled by Dave Grohl's drums—of "honey." Things take a loungey, trip-hop turn on "Lilith," while "Girl Is a Gun" practically trembles under a heavy-adrenaline beat. "Darling" lifts the bittersweet folk Halsey flirted with on their last album, 2020's Manic, to a new apex, complete with feather-delicate acoustic guitar by Lindsey Buckingham. "The Lighthouse" is also a treat: Mr. Serious Reznor full on embraces pop, piling on showy goth synth with swagger while a purring Halsey winkingly bounces along a hopscotch melody. "You Asked for This" is '80s-pop irresistible, its power chorus and thick guitar layers (courtesy of TV on the Radio's Dave Sitek) putting a candy coating on indecision. "Go on and be a big girl, you asked for this," Halsey—now partnered up and with a baby— sings, poking at the idea of domesticity like it's a tender bruise. "You wished upon a falling star/ And then left behind the avant-garde ... You better kiss good night and give some head ... Well, is this the life that lies ahead now?" There are killer lines all over the place; "Jesus needed a three-day weekend/ To sort out all his bullshit," from the bleak and icy "Bells of Santa Fe," is a standout. "Whispers" is strikingly clever, too, a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde scenario where the exaggeratedly whispered lines ("You do not want him ...You do not want this") are the voice of Halsey's self-cannibalizing inner predator: "I've got a monster inside me that eats personality types/ She's constantly changing her mind on the daily." It all ends with tender "Ya'aburnee, its title loosely translating from Arabic as the desire for your loved one to die before you do because you can't go on without them. "Darling you will bury me, before I bury you," Halsey sings, a declaration of great romance, selfishness and despair all at once. © Shelly Ridenour/Qobuz	13	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:55:02.952132	1

Building upon 2021's revelatory opus If I Can't Have Love, I Want Power, Impersonator continues in that exploratory vein with the help of the album's conceptual conceit. Adopting the personas of her favorite icons through the decades (and even her 2014 self), Halsey crafts faithful sound-alikes on the more exciting cuts, while absorbing the energy of others on less obvious selections. Indeed, part of the fun is trying to hear how Halsey chose to honor her inspirations, providing a fascinating view into her creative process. Even without peeking at the notes, some are immediately apparent: Stevie Nicks twirls through the instantly familiar "Panic Attack"; PJ Harvey slinks out of the dark on the dissonant "Dog Years"; Britney Spears' bittersweet lyrics are interpolated on the Monica-sampling ode "Lucky"; and Bruce Springsteen leaps from the "I'm On Fire"-esque "Letter to God (1983)." Meanwhile, Joni Mitchell's patient guitar work and sparse vocal harmony inform "The End"; Dolores O'Riordan's signature "doo doo doo" vocalizations pepper the coming-of-age rocker "Ego"; Dolly Parton stomps along to the charming, down-home jam "Hometown"; and Starman-era Bowie drifts through the lonely, piano-backed "Darwinism" (which sounds like it could have been on If I Can't Have Love…). Kate Bush (the shimmering pop gem "I Never Loved You"), Cher ("Letter to God [1974]"), Linda Ronstadt ("I Believe in Magic"), Fiona Apple (the jazzy, trip-hoppy haunter "Arsonist"), and Evanescence's Amy Lee (the dramatic rocker "Lonely Is the Muse") are also along for the ride. Digging deeper, less obvious allusions buffer the journey, like on the touching "Letter to God (1998)" -- which incorporates vocal samples of Halsey's child in the spirit of the baby coos from Aaliyah's "Are You That Somebody?" -- and "Life of the Spider (Draft)," an unflinching, unpolished piano confessional inspired by Tori Amos. On an album of standout moments and exciting surprises, the delightful title track -- inspired by Björk -- is an absolute highlight, fluttering along harp trills colored by electric guitar riffs, and punctuated by playful, sprite-like vocalizations unlike anything Halsey's ever sung before. If that seems like a lot, it is. However, with such variation in styles and approach, The Great Impersonator reveals something new with each listen, it's a rewarding experience for longtime fans and curious newcomers alike. Mining her musical upbringing and honoring her myriad inspirations, Halsey comes full circle, connecting her own youth and innocence with intimate adult ruminations on parenthood, aging, and legacy. It's an engrossing homage to the figures that made her into the artist -- and inspiration -- that she has become herself.© Neil Z. Yeung /TiVo	10	CD	2026-01-18 21:55:02.952133	2

Two years later, Badlands finds the 20-year-old budding pop sensation delivering a set of songs that sound a lot like that fateful first single. Which isn't a bad thing. The sound that defined their D.I.Y. music is still apparent, though they did collaborate here with a handful of like-minded producers including Lido, the Futuristics, and Son Lux, who helped flesh out their highly personal songs into even more dramatic, sonically dense recordings. On the surface, Badlands is all chilly atmosphere, thanks to a bevy of thick bass tones, pulsing synthesizers, and rattlesnake percussion loops. It's a goth throwback that brings to mind Danny Lohner's work with Nine Inch Nails. However, underneath that icy landscape, Halsey burns with a feminist confidence, spitting out lyrics with their soulful voice that sounds like Björk with vocal fry. On "Castle," they sing "I'm headed straight for the castle/They've got the kingdom locked up/And there's an old man sitting on a throne they're saying, 'I should probably keep my pretty mouth shut.'" Of course, it's clear from the start of Badlands that keeping their mouth shut is the last thing Halsey plans to do. As they proclaim on the taut, slow-tempo jam "Hold Me Down," "My demons are begging me to open up my mouth." Thankfully, Halsey consistently brings a strong sense of self to their content at every turn, musing with blithe emotion about their sexuality and creative independence. They also have a knack for singling out little generational touchstones that lend their songs an anthemic quality. On "New Americana," their vocals double-tracked like the children's chorus on Pink Floyd's "Another Brick in the Wall," they sing, "We are the new Americana/High on legal marijuana/Raised on Biggie and Nirvana." Interestingly, while their noir-ish, older-than-their-years image has drawn comparisons to contemporaries like Lana Del Rey and Lorde (and yes, there are similarities) musically, they have more in common with male-fronted acts like New York's X Ambassadors, merging dark, electronic indie with the rhythmic bump and lyrical flow of R&B. There's also something angry, literate, and youthfully defiant about Badlands that brings to mind the sneer of Garbage's Shirley Manson. Ultimately, it's all of Halsey's seemingly contradictory elements brought together that lend Badlands such a fascinating topography.© Matt Collar /TiVo	37	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:55:02.952135	1
929945	Manic	Halsey	85.82	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/sb/bs/ej9kdog25bssb_600.jpg	qobuz:84613787|ej9kdog25bssb	As they were in the throes of completing their third studio album in 2019, Halsey told Rolling Stone the record would contain "hip-hop, rock, country, f***ing everything because it's so manic. It's soooooo manic." It was so manic, Halsey decided Manic was the right title for this high-profile album, the first they've released since 2017's Hopeless Fountain Kingdom helped turn them into a regular presence at the top of the charts. As it turns out, Manic is indeed an appropriate name for an album so filled with twists and turns it feels like a double-LP crammed into the course of a 47-minute record. Such a description is slightly misleading, though, suggesting that the album contains a series of distinct shifts in mood when it is very much a record of its moment, thrumming along to the tasteful shape-shifting hybrids that populate playlists of all genres. Listen closely, certain stylistic aspects assert themselves -- a fingerpicked guitar line rolls along here, there's a reggae bounce there -- and their choice of guest stars is telling. Alanis Morissette -- who is by some measures a clear precursor to Halsey -- vies with rapper Dominic Fike and Suga of K-pop sensations BTS for the splashiest cameo, with each of their appearances labeled as an "interlude." The lack of concrete song titles winds up emphasizing the presence of artists who cross genres, a clear sign of how Manic's seemingly scattershot appearance disguises that Halsey designed the album to appeal to as broad an audience as possible, streamlining all these sounds so they slide onto every conceivable playlist. It's a shrewd ploy that winds up not seeming crass thanks to Halsey's affectless emo bloodletting -- she never resists an opportunity to hit their target squarely on the nose, such as the "I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you" refrain on "You Should Be Sad" -- and the clever way Manic is sequenced. The artiest, wobbliest songs start the record, followed by their saddest and starkest ballads, so it takes a while before it settles into its comfortable groove of adolescent angst doubling as AAA crossover pop. Such distinctions would be lost on the playlists individual tracks may later call home, but assembled in this fashion as a proper album, Manic showcases Halsey at their nerviest and at their best.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	24	CD	2026-01-18 21:55:02.952136	2

127417	Camila	Camila Cabello	135.36	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/ib/lp/z2d2qhkjilpib_600.jpg	qobuz:46448897|z2d2qhkjilpib	The debut solo album by singer Camila Cabello, the eponymously titled Camila, is a warmly produced set of romantic pop punctuated by several rhythmically infectious Latin-influenced tracks informed by her Cuban heritage. Notably, Camila comes roughly two years after Cabello's much publicized departure from the all-female pop ensemble Fifth Harmony. While her exit begged some concerns (Was she a self-centered diva? Or just a singer with an abundance of personality and creative drive?), the release of several pre-album singles, most notably the deliciously steamy, piano-driven "Havana" (featuring rapper Young Thug), largely turned audiences in her favor. Purportedly, the reaction was so favorable it cause Cabellod (who was born in Cuba and raised in Miami) and her producers (Frank Dukes, Jarami, Skrillex, and others) to delay the album's release, adding songs that better reflected the Latin vibe of "Havana." Whatever the case, it worked, and there are several other Latin-inflected songs here, including the sultry, electronica-tinged, dancehall-ready "She Loves Control," and the buoyantly percussive, steel drum-flavored "Inside Out," in which Cabello sings briefly in Spanish. Along with the aforementioned "Havana," these are easily the most potent songs on the album, and showcase Cabello's effusively resonant voice and playful charisma. Elsewhere, cuts like the R&B-tinged anthem "All These Years" and the yearning, singer/songwriter-esque "Consequences" are emotionally resonant, lyrical songs that stick with you. There are also some nice, upbeat pop moments like the euphoric opener "Never Be the Same," with its falsetto pre-chorus and deftly placed Afro-Cuban drum sample. Similarly engaging is the steamy late-album banger "Into It," in which Cabello wryly coos to her would-be paramour, "Add up the things I wanna do to you, it's infinite/I mean...if you're into it." With tracks as contagious as "Into It" and "Havana," it's hard to imagine even the most resolute Fifth Harmony devotee not getting into it. Ultimately, Camila is a refreshing debut that makes good on Cabello's flight to pop freedom with songs that feel like they were borne out her own life experience and artistic point of view.© Matt Collar /TiVo	28	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:55:08.078001	1
386670	Romance	Camila Cabello	374.82	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/za/vi/uxebf40z7viza_600.jpg	qobuz:80370402|uxebf40z7viza	The American-Cuban-Mexican singer Camila Cabello once again has fun with her Latino origins on her second album, following on from Camila in 2018. Songs such as Liar and Señorita are characterised by a conglomerate of diverse musical influences from Latino culture. The former is a mix of Puerto Rican trap and flamenco (hand clapping included) which she sings in duet with the Canadian singer Shawn Mendes, while the latter is a ballad with a melody and guitar reminiscent of José Feliciano. Though since she does not want to be reduced to a cliché, other songs are much less stereotypical. Such is the case with the slow sixties sound of This Love and the sombre piano/voice combo which concludes the album (First Man). The album’s lyrics depict a Camila Cabello who, once again, plays around with Latino stereotypes. She uses religious imagery to describe relationships on Living Proof (Madonna doesn’t feel too far away) and gets her claws out to protect her feelings on Cry For Me. The theme of jealousy, as well as an exacerbated romanticism and an unrestrained sexuality, are at the heart of the former X Factor candidate’s work. Camila Cabello just goes to disprove the line “blondes have more fun”! © Nicolas Magenham/Qobuz	11	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:55:08.078007	1

The Cuban-born singer celebrates her family by blood, as well as her chosen family, “those you want to break bread with”, she explains. Food is another running theme throughout this album, which opens with a trumpet solo performed by the man who wrote the song, Mike Cordone, harking back to the young singer’s Cuban roots. Like a metaphor for the big family Camila Cabello wants to have around her, her album mixes a variety of musical genres, ranging from pop and even disco rhythms (Hasta Los Dientes) to cumbia and salsa. Flamenco guitars can also be heard in Don't Go Yet, a song about the difficulty of leaving people you're having a good time with. Camila Cabello also peppers the album with references to legendary songwriting figures: the intro to Psychofreak is an obvious nod to Tom’s Diner by Suzanne Vega. Vocals from Alejandro Cabello, Camila’s father, are also featured on La Buena Vida, a song that’s the equivalent of the telenovelas that are so typical of Latin American culture. The track Lola tackles sexism and corruption with nonchalant rumba rhythm. The album concludes with a duet alongside Ed Sheeran, in which reggaeton and salsa come together in perfect harmony (Bam Bam). © Nicolas Magenham/Qobuz	34	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:55:08.078008	1

Her follow-up to 2022's Familia, 2024's C,XOXO finds the Havana-born, Florida-raised Cabello entering her bleach-blonde era, both literally and figuratively, as she embraces her inner Miami party girl and celebrates the sweaty, dayglow club atmosphere of her hometown. The aforementioned lyric pops up in "Chanel No. 5," a woozy, minimalist R&B number built around a fractured piano riff that sounds like it was lifted off a warped vinyl children's LP, all of which nicely encapsulates the consciously brand-centric, 2000s Zeitgeist atmosphere Cabello is exploring here. Produced by Pablo Díaz-Reixa (aka El Guincho), Jasper Harris, and Daniel Aged, C,XOXO is a bold sonic departure for the singer, eschewing much of the Latin-tinged pop of her past work in favor of a sleazy, hyperpop sound marked by dump-truck synths, clipped trap beats, and a tidal wave of Auto-Tuned vocals. This is an album of Cabello feeling herself, leaning into the club-going experiences and romantic heartbreak of her past, and transforming them into moments of aspirational bliss. This is especially true on the opening "I Luv It," where she turns her sexual empowerment into a never-ending bass drop, an experiential "meteor shower" that could go on forever but for sure won't. That the song also manages to take a sample of Gucci Mane's "Lemonade" and a guest appearance by mumble rapper Playboi Carti and push all of it together in a cohesive fashion, speaking to Cabello's clear aesthetic vision and her strong grasp on her influences. Equally potent guest spots pop up elsewhere, including Lil Nas X on the flirty, disco-house-infused "I Think He Knows" and JT and Yung Miami of City Girls, who take a ride on the euphoric, evocatively titled hip-hop anthem "Dade County Dreaming." Prime among the guests, however, is Drake, who duets with Cabello on the sultry electro-dancehall number "Hot Uptown." That said, one might be left wondering why Drake is essentially allowed to sing solo on "Uuugly," a baffling choice on an album that otherwise does a good job focusing on its star. Another interesting if vexing decision is the addition of several mood-setting interludes, including what amounts to a spoken confessional by rapper BPL Kosher praising Cabello's music. At just over 30 minutes in length, C,XOXO is breezy, and these short interludes come off as somewhat superfluous. Regardless, the album is never boring, leaving you with the sense that Cabello is letting loose and blowing off some creative musical steam. She also gives herself some room to dig into some deeper emotions, as on the synthy, neon-lit R&B anthem "DREAM-GIRLS" and the acoustic guitar-driven ballad "Twentysomethings,'' both of which ruminate on ways even the wildest club kids can mature into themselves. At its best, C,XOXO is a vibes album, musical perfume -- a spritz of Cabello's "meteor shower" pop moment.© Matt Collar /TiVo	15	CD	2026-01-18 21:55:18.009594	2

Just as the sun never sets, this party never stops, and youth remains eternal for as long as possible. Larsson's vocals are the main draw, which remains a strong echo of Rihanna, while the production -- provided by longtime collaborator MNEK as well as Margo XS, Zhone, and Helena Gao -- leans toward the Charli xcx-Caroline Polachek spectrum of contemporary pop. There's a bevy of catchy beats that skitter and rattle throughout the tight ten-song set, from the euphoric hyperpop of the title track to the playful raver "Puss Puss" (which means "kiss kiss" in Swedish). The pounding electroclash "Pretty Ugly" is a defiant empowerment statement and might be the loudest, most aggressive song in Larsson's catalog to date, pushing the "Hollaback Girl" cheerleader energy to the brink. "Hot & Sexy" keeps that confrontational, do-what-I-wanna spirit alive, injecting some ballroom and trap into the mix. R&B sensuality and a house heartbeat carry the fantasy-baiting "Girl's Girl," while the pulsing club anthem "Crush" and the funky, Latin-tinged "Eurosummer" offer hedonistic, youthful release. Aside from the beat-forward dancefloor fodder, Larsson takes the time to explore her own growth as a 27-year-old on the carefree yet introspective "Saturn's Return," which captures her musings on life as the glimmering production swells around her soaring, angelic vocals. Stripping away the party-loving attitude, that matured perspective returns as she reveals her aspirations on the heartfelt "The Ambition," which analyzes her experiences with the highs and lows of fame. This refreshing honesty and reflective insight might not be as exciting as the immediate pop bangers, but they help elevate Midnight Sun to something more refined and graceful. Short and sweet, this catalog highlight benefits from its length, offering just enough of what Larsson does best to have listeners craving more of this endless bliss.© Neil Z.

Along with the refreshed sound is a newfound artistic freedom: it's the first album released on her own Sommer House label. That liberated spirit -- the titular inner goddess of the title -- courses through Venus, which balances the usual pop-R&B style of her earlier work with rhythmic mainstream bops and some subtle emotional sweep. The playful singalong "You Love Who You Love" and the epic, string-backed "End of Time" build atop a persistent throb and soaring vocals, channeling the addictive, singsong style of Ava Max. Meanwhile, lead single "Can't Tame Her" careens down the midnight freeway of an '80s action flick, resurrecting that decade's full-throttle synth anthem energy. The sleek "None of These Guys" drips with attitude and a cold, pulsing beat, while David Guetta lends his festival-sized house production to "On My Love," a reunion with the superstar DJ that sounds like Rihanna's turn-of-the-decade ravers. Larsson stretches her usual range with the bittersweet piano ballad "Soundtrack" -- which references Radiohead, Joni Mitchell, and "Hallelujah" as she reflects on a past love -- and the aptly titled "The Healing," another delicate piano-based dose of vulnerability. Everything comes together on the triumphant title track, which merges the synth-bop energy of the album's big radio-friendly singles and the emotional depth of "Soundtrack" to maximum effect, opening Larsson's eyes to a new world full of love and possibility. Personal but still very fun, Venus is a bold but totally sensical evolution in sound that avoids a third LP of the same old songs and pushes Larsson's sonic style into the future.© Neil Z.

Just as the sun never sets, this party never stops, and youth remains eternal for as long as possible. Larsson's vocals are the main draw, which remains a strong echo of Rihanna, while the production -- provided by longtime collaborator MNEK as well as Margo XS, Zhone, and Helena Gao -- leans toward the Charli xcx-Caroline Polachek spectrum of contemporary pop. There's a bevy of catchy beats that skitter and rattle throughout the tight ten-song set, from the euphoric hyperpop of the title track to the playful raver "Puss Puss" (which means "kiss kiss" in Swedish). The pounding electroclash "Pretty Ugly" is a defiant empowerment statement and might be the loudest, most aggressive song in Larsson's catalog to date, pushing the "Hollaback Girl" cheerleader energy to the brink. "Hot & Sexy" keeps that confrontational, do-what-I-wanna spirit alive, injecting some ballroom and trap into the mix. R&B sensuality and a house heartbeat carry the fantasy-baiting "Girl's Girl," while the pulsing club anthem "Crush" and the funky, Latin-tinged "Eurosummer" offer hedonistic, youthful release. Aside from the beat-forward dancefloor fodder, Larsson takes the time to explore her own growth as a 27-year-old on the carefree yet introspective "Saturn's Return," which captures her musings on life as the glimmering production swells around her soaring, angelic vocals. Stripping away the party-loving attitude, that matured perspective returns as she reveals her aspirations on the heartfelt "The Ambition," which analyzes her experiences with the highs and lows of fame. This refreshing honesty and reflective insight might not be as exciting as the immediate pop bangers, but they help elevate Midnight Sun to something more refined and graceful. Short and sweet, this catalog highlight benefits from its length, offering just enough of what Larsson does best to have listeners craving more of this endless bliss.© Neil Z.

Funk, electro, soul, ‘90s R&B, a rap collaboration or two, Frank Ocean blends it all into this unique record. Although there are slight hints of artists such as Stevie Wonder, Prince and Marvin Gaye, Ocean is most certainly his own artist with his own distinct style, and in many ways he defies classification. It’s this originality that makes Frank Ocean and Channel ORANGE so artistically intriguing. The Californian paints a picture and tells a story with each song, some more personal, some more observational. After the 45 second introduction of Start, which you could easily imagine being accompanied by a screen reading “loading…”, comes Thinkin Bout You, a track that had been circulating online for around a year by the time Channel ORANGE was released. Displaying great vocal range with his use of falsetto, Ocean spends Thinkin Bout You looking back on a first love and its complications, “Yes, of course, I remember how could I forget how you feel? You know you were my first time, a new feel” he sings as he evokes this relationship. The track creates a very personal atmosphere which pulls us into the singer’s feelings. As well as more personal tracks like the latter, the album consists of a series of short stories from Ocean’s point of view on the various types of characters that reside in society. From the super rich of high society (Sweet Life and Super Rich Kids featuring fellow Odd Future member Earl Sweatshirt) to outcast junkies (Crack Rock), a cocaine-cooking girlfriend (Lost) and the Forrest Gump types (Forrest Gump), Frank Ocean takes us on a tour of contrasting universes. The almost 10-minute-long single Pyramids is a journey in itself as it travels from Cleopatra's electro-infused ancient Egypt to a modern day, slow jam, motel love story of a pimp and his stripper, “she’s workin’ at the Pyramid tonight” Ocean sings. Bad Religion signals a return to the more personal side of the album as Frank Ocean takes a ride in the back of a cab in an attempt to escape his feelings. Something most can relate to. Many have made the connection between Bad Religion and that all famous letter that broke the internet back in 2012. The track seems to reflect what was expressed in the letter which tells the story of Ocean and his first love, especially when you consider the lyric “I can never make him love me”. With its mix of styles, its flawless vocals and its richness of narrative content, Channel ORANGE is quite brilliant. © Euan Decourt/Qobuz	16	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:55:37.259726	1

After 2016’s Starboy and the EP My Dear Melancholy 2 years later, the chart-topping singer made his acting debut in the Netflix thriller Uncut Gems alongside Adam Sandler. This may have been behind the inspiration for this new character the singer portrays with a broken nose, leather gloves and deep red tux in the album cover and the music video for lead single Blinding Lights, reminiscent of A-Ha’s Take On Me, the new wave from the 1980s and its synthwave revival. “I don’t like to leave my house too much. It’s a gift and a curse but it helps me give undivided attention to my work… It distracts from the loneliness, I guess”, confesses the Canadian. Unlike Starboy, there are no features on this album, The Weeknd choosing instead to invite a range of top tier producers to refine the music: Metro Boomin on the epilogue Until I Bleed Out, Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker on Repeat After Me (Interlude), the loyal Illangelo, vaporwave pioneer Oneohtrix Point Never for Scared to Live and even hitmaker Max Martin (Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Britney Spears) for the pop-sounding Save Your Tears, resulting in 14 tracks that blend soul, R&B and new wave nuances. ©️ Charlotte Saintoin/Qobuz	24	CD	2026-01-18 21:56:02.965941	2
380758	Starboy (Explicit Version)	The Weeknd	377.37	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/89/21/0060255732189_600.jpg	qobuz:36681010|0060255732189	The extent of the 2015 Weeknd commercial rebound, symbolized by platinum certifications for Beauty Behind the Madness and all four of its singles, didn't merely embolden Abel Tesfaye. On this follow-up's fourth track, a blithe midtempo cut where Tesfaye takes a swipe at pretenders while boasting about drinking codeine out of one of his trophies, the level of success is a source of amusement. He notes the absurdity in taking a "kids' show" award for "Can't Feel My Face," in which he was "talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow." The track actually lost to Adele's "Hello," but it clearly, somewhat comically, reached an unintended demographic. It comes as no surprise that Tesfaye, on his third proper album, doesn't attempt to optimize the reach of his biggest hit by consciously targeting youngsters. He sings of being a "Starboy" with access to a fleet of sports cars, but he's a "motherfuckin' starboy," one who is 26 years old and proud to observe his woman snort cocaine off his fancy table. While Starboy often reflects an increased opulence in the personal and professional aspects of Tesfaye's life -- from more upscale pronouns to expensive collaborations with the likes of Daft Punk (two) and "Can't Feel My Face" producers Max Martin and Ali Payami (four) -- the dark moments of vulnerability are pitch black. Lines like "I switch up my cup, I kill any pain" could have come from Tesfaye's mixtape debut, yet there are new levels of torment. In "Ordinary Life," he considers driving off a Mulholland Drive cliff, James Dean style, wishing he could swap everything for angel status. It's followed with "Nothing Without You," a ballad of toxic dysfunction. He asks his lover if she'd feel guilty for not answering his call if he happened to die that night. It's not all dread and depravity. There's some sense of joy in a one-night stand, and an echo of "Say Say Say" Michael Jackson, on the Luomo-ish house track "Rockin'." Contrition is shown in the slick retro-modern disco-funk of "A Lonely Night." Ironically enough, in the aching "True Colors," Tesfaye sounds a little insecure about a lover's past. The album's lighter, comparatively sweeter parts -- the Tears for Fears-sampling/Romantics-referencing "Secrets" and the breezy and only slightly devilish "I Feel It Coming" among them -- are all welcome highlights. When pared down to its ten best songs, Starboy sounds like Tesfaye's most accomplished work.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	8	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:02.965944	1
734999	Beauty Behind The Madness (Explicit Version)	The Weeknd	257.32	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/34/03/0060254750334_600.jpg	qobuz:26769251|0060254750334	All bets regarding Abel Tesfaye's career arc were off once Trilogy, material previously released at no (financial) cost to the listener, went platinum. For a period after that, it seemed like the singer had peaked just short of pop-star status. His eager congregation pushed Kiss Land, the proper debut, to number two in the U.S., yet none of its singles, not even the one that featured Drake, reached the Hot 100. "Love Me Harder," a duet with labelmate Ariana Grande released in 2014, proved to be a masterstroke. It put Tesfaye in the Top Ten for the first time and began a streak of similarly effective singles that preceded -- and are included on -- Beauty Behind the Madness. "Earned It," a ballad recorded for the Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack, showed that he could adapt to a traditional pop backdrop. That cut a path for "The Hills," in which Tesfaye alleviated his "day one" base with a typically degenerate slow jam, co-produced by Illangelo, that affirmed "When I'm fucked up, that's the real me" while taking the toxic narrative a step further with lines like "Drugs started feelin' like it's decaf." And then "Can't Feel My Face," a sleek slice of retro-modern disco-funk produced by Max Martin and Ali Payami, landed in June 2015. An obvious pop move, it worked -- it went to number one in the U.S. and several other territories. Tesfaye skillfully delivered his biggest hooks as he sang about dependency in that part-anguished, part-euphoric fashion derived from Michael Jackson. Like its advance singles, the rest of Beauty Behind the Madness is R&B and pop as drug-den paella: chemical and sexual abasement, self-loathing, and self-absorbed belligerence over narcotized sludge and less expected moves that peak with the wholly sweet "As You Are" and crest with a big-band diversion on "Losers." Collaborations with Kanye West, Ed Sheeran, and Lana Del Rey add star power; the last of that pack contributes to a moment where Tesfaye turns another corner by acknowledging a dead end through the fog, "addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold." The commercial strides are obvious. The creative advancements are less apparent, but they're in there.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	39	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:02.965944	1
243952	Dawn FM	The Weeknd	329.13	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/wc/mi/o1sxzgofpmiwc_600.jpg	qobuz:143431217|o1sxzgofpmiwc	"Blinding Lights" artistically and commercially was so optimal for Abel Tesfaye that it quickly became his signature song, and was only two years old when Billboard announced that it had rocketed past Chubby Checker's "The Twist" to claim the title of all-time number one hit. For the follow-up to "Blinding Lights" parent album After Hours, Tesfaye delves deeper into the early- to mid-'80s pop aesthetic. He resurfaces with a conceptual sequel designed as a broadcast heard by a motorist stuck in a purgatorial tunnel. The primary collaborators are "Blinding Lights" co-producers Max Martin and Oscar Holter, plus fellow After Hours cohort Daniel Lopatin, whose airwaves-themed 2020 LP Magic Oneohtrix Point Never was executive produced by Tesfaye. Instead of scrambled voices like those heard on the OPN album, Dawn FM features recurrent announcements from Jim Carrey as a serene and faintly creepy character, or maybe himself, intonating end-of-life entertainment and counsel. The other unlikely appearances -- Quincy Jones with a spoken autobiographical interlude, Beach Boy Bruce Johnston somewhere in the cocksure "how it's going" outlier "Here We Go...Again" -- are ostentatious. In the main, this is a space for Tesfaye to fully indulge his frantic romantic side as his co-conspirators whip up fluorescent throwback Euro-pop with muscle and nuance. Tesfaye's almost fathomless vocal facility elevates even the most rudimentary expressions of co-dependency, despair, regret, and obsession, and he helps it all go down easier with station ID jingles and an amusingly hyped-up ad for "a compelling work of science fiction" called (the) "After Life." The set peaks early with a sequence of dejected post-disco jams that writhe, percolate, and chug. Most of these songs surpass the bulk of Daft Punk's similarly backward-gazing Random Access Memories, projecting the same lust for life with underlying existential doom as Italo disco nuggets such as Ryan Paris' "Dolce Vita." Toward the end of that first-half stretch, Tesfaye reaffirms his R&B roots and affinity for Michael Jackson with a cut built from Alicia Myers' 1981 gospel boogie classic "I Want to Thank You." After that, it slows down and stretches out a bit to varying effect, dipping into Japanese city pop for the bittersweet and remorseful "Out of Time" and edging ever so achingly toward Latin freestyle with "Don't Break My Heart." Just before Carrey's epilogue, Tesfaye and company pick up the pace with "Less Than Zero." Rather than use the title as a prompt to sink back into detailing debauchery, Tesfaye makes the song this album's "Scared to Live," a sentimental ballad that's hard to resist.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	33	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:02.965945	1

Shortly after the release and the worldwide success of After Hours in 2020, and without a doubt one of his best projects, The Highlights is a synthesis of ten years of music, ten years spent defining modern pop. So, let's say it right away, there are no surprises here in terms of the track list. We find The Weeknd's hits, including the latest phenomenon, Blinding Lights, but also I Feel it Coming , a duet with Daft Punk, or The Hills, which truly transformed him into a global pop star in 2016. With no new material, this Greatest Hits allows you to retrace the Canadian's discography, but also to make some detours through projects other than his albums, in particular thanks to Earned It from the soundtrack to the film 50 Shades of Grey, to Pray For Me from Black Panther, or Love Me Harder, featuring Ariana Grande and released on the album My Everything by the latter in 2014. © Brice Miclet/Qobuz	25	CD	2026-01-18 21:56:02.965945	2

After the eponymous Vampire Weekend (2008), Contra (2010) and Modern Vampires of the City (2013), Ezra Koenig’s band took a six-year break punctuated by the departure of the very influential Rostam Batmanglij who released an excellent solo record Half-Light in 2017. Their last album to date, Modern Vampires of the City, was a distinctive evolution in the works of the New York combo. The Talking Heads influence had been abandoned for a more refined and polished pop sound, found as much in the melodies and harmonies as in its style.Koenig, now the main creative force left in the group, has left New York and relocated to LA. Father of the Bride confirms his artistic ambition. His central style remains inherently pop, but each of the 18 songs in the album offer a different outlook. There is a bit of everything in this copious record; The Beatles, Beach Boys, Fleetwood Mac, Supertramp, Paul Simon, Wilco, Grateful Dead and hundreds of other influences can be noted. The collaborators on the album are equally diverse: the pedal steel and impressionist guitars of Greg Leisz, the voice of Danielle Haim of HAIM, the guitar of Dave Longstreth of the Dirty Projectors, Steve Lacy of the Internet and even Rostam enters the fold on two titles. While listening to the record, one might ask themselves if Ezra Koenig has made a White Album (the most eclectic album by the Beatles) all by himself… © Marc Zisman/Qobuz	11	CD	2026-01-18 21:56:02.965945	2

"Heartless," a boastful belter made with Metro Boomin, Illangelo, and Dre Moon, ticked all the boxes to please Abel Tesfaye's base. Pills, cars, fame, women, and the hard-fought reward for all the overindulgence -- a ruthless world view to keep the cycle going -- were all in the mix. "Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need/Tryin' to find the one that can fix me," contradictory and confused as ever, made the song entirely on brand. Then came the Max Martin-produced isolation anthem "Blinding Lights," an instance of Tesfaye reanimating mid-'80s Euro-pop like he did with "Wanderlust." These contrasting previews didn't give away the fact that After Hours is, above all else, a breakup album. Tesfaye fills much of this neatly sequenced, ballad-heavy set with penitence and longing. He sets the tone with an escapist fantasy that turns into a nightmarish relapse, and is tormented for much of the duration by seeking and receiving salvation and ruination from the same relationship. Some of Tesfaye's most vivid and piercing lines are herein. Mere minutes after dropping the superbly dispirited "I saw you dancing in a crowded room/You look so happy when I'm not with you," he taunts with "You don't love him, you're just f*ckin'," repeating it like he's convincing himself that he's not jealous. You know he's got it bad when he says he "don't even wanna get high no more." In addition to supplying familiar trap-styled prowling backdrops and some other '80s flashbacks, Tesfaye and his varying team of co-producers refer to some softer points in the U.K. hardcore continuum dating back to the late '90s -- drum'n'bass on "Hardest to Love," 2-step garage and early dubstep on "Too Late" -- modernizing them with finesse. Tesfaye and Martin venture farthest when they meet synthesizer wiz Daniel Lopatin in a dead mall, down by the old Tape World, for "Scared to Live," an adult contemporary number that alludes to '70s Elton John but has more in common with '80s love themes by Phil Collins and Lionel Richie. It's so clean and down the middle that it resembles a box-office crossover bid from an artiste swallowing his pride to record a tame song he didn't write. It happens to be one of Tesfaye's best performances, his voice soaring and swooping, signifying numbness and codependency, sorrowful about wasted time while encouraging emotional convalescence. It fits into the album and is a Weeknd song as much as the one in which Tesfaye rap-sings of self-harm and addiction, providing financial support for family and friends, and giving his woman "Philip K. dick."© Andy Kellman /TiVo	34	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:02.965947	1
445512	My Dear Melancholy,	The Weeknd	89.08	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/9a/1k/wr0t5yl7h1k9a_600.jpg	qobuz:48182121|wr0t5yl7h1k9a	The Weeknd is going back to his roots on this surprise album (or half album) that he has gifted the world. After a collaborative album with Daft Punk (Starboy), which shot him to international stardom and also brought him a Grammy, the R&B singer from “The 6” (Toronto Metropolitan Area) has shifted back to a more personal effort. Abel Tesfaye, or alias The Weeknd co-writes 6 deeply personal tracks that focus on love, drugs and sex, the perfect formula for an R&B album. He opens up more than ever about his current trials and tribulations with relationships, but his pain is our gain. The 21 minutes of music is vintage The Weeknd from his album Trilogy, deeply chilling with distressed synths and spacey falsetto vocals. OG fans of The Weeknd will love this record, while it will still create many new ones.	8	CD	2026-01-18 21:56:02.965947	2
630922	Trilogy	The Weeknd	51.52	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/ua/fl/lr1isr1b6flua_600.jpg	qobuz:234746181|lr1isr1b6flua	Abel Tesfaye, aka the Weeknd, released three free mixtapes, aka albums, in 2011. Trilogy compiles them with remastered sound and adds three new songs. Supported by fellow Toronto native Drake, Tesfaye surfaced that March with House of Balloons, an impressive debut that merged his paradoxical approach -- sweet voice, poisonous words -- with gloomy but entrancing productions, most of which were provided by Illangelo and Doc McKinney. The duo produced the entirety of Thursday, released that August. It offered minor variations on the debut's themes of getting laid and high through plodding, thudding scenes of bleak malevolence. Anyone not magnetized to extended periods of intense wallowing and/or chemically-induced lethargy -- or the idea of experiencing either one of the two states -- could discern that Tesfaye could have used an editor. And then, in December, just after Drake released Take Care, an album featuring a handful of Tesfaye collaborations, Echoes of Silence completed the Weeknd trilogy in an equally excessive fashion. Emboldened by critical acclaim and an enthusiastic fan base, Tesfaye led the set, produced mostly by Illangelo, with a cover of "Dirty Diana," Michael Jackson's unintentionally comical groupie nightmare. Tesfaye not only matched the original's intensity but went so over the top with it that the top was no longer visible. He also continued to find slightly different, occasionally peculiar ways of expressing unapologetically sordid feelings about drugs, partying, drugs, bad girls, drugs, strippers, drugs, good girls gone bad, and drugs -- all of which serve an identical purpose and get the same level of consideration, though "Put that rum down, you don't wanna die tonight" is at least somewhat thoughtful. There are points throughout these works where Tesfaye is distinctively gripping, supplying deadly hooks and somehow singing for his life despite the cold blood flowing through his veins. More often, he needs restraint, as he is prone to repetitious whining that is more young boy than young Keith Sweat. (Check "Same Old Song," 20 percent of which features Tesfaye singing "You're the same old song," over and over, with the final "o" held for several seconds.) Now that he's with a label, he'll hopefully get some kind of filter that enables him to fulfill the promise heard in these 160 minutes of one-dimensional, occasionally exhilarating overindulgence. When this package was released, he was gaining mainstream momentum with appearances on Drake's "Crew Love" and Wiz Khalifa's "Remember You." His potential is as obvious as his lyrics are toxic.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	9	CD	2026-01-18 21:56:02.965947	2

After 2016’s Starboy and the EP My Dear Melancholy 2 years later, the chart-topping singer made his acting debut in the Netflix thriller Uncut Gems alongside Adam Sandler. This may have been behind the inspiration for this new character the singer portrays with a broken nose, leather gloves and deep red tux in the album cover and the music video for lead single Blinding Lights, reminiscent of A-Ha’s Take On Me, the new wave from the 1980s and its synthwave revival. “I don’t like to leave my house too much. It’s a gift and a curse but it helps me give undivided attention to my work… It distracts from the loneliness, I guess”, confesses the Canadian. Unlike Starboy, there are no features on this album, The Weeknd choosing instead to invite a range of top tier producers to refine the music: Metro Boomin on the epilogue Until I Bleed Out, Tame Impala’s Kevin Parker on Repeat After Me (Interlude), the loyal Illangelo, vaporwave pioneer Oneohtrix Point Never for Scared to Live and even hitmaker Max Martin (Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Britney Spears) for the pop-sounding Save Your Tears, resulting in 14 tracks that blend soul, R&B and new wave nuances. ©️ Charlotte Saintoin/Qobuz	29	CD	2026-01-18 21:56:02.965948	2

156285	Starboy	The Weeknd	97.54	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/wb/k3/d6wujbl0ik3wb_600.jpg	qobuz:201590277|d6wujbl0ik3wb	The extent of the 2015 Weeknd commercial rebound, symbolized by platinum certifications for Beauty Behind the Madness and all four of its singles, didn't merely embolden Abel Tesfaye. On this follow-up's fourth track, a blithe midtempo cut where Tesfaye takes a swipe at pretenders while boasting about drinking codeine out of one of his trophies, the level of success is a source of amusement. He notes the absurdity in taking a "kids' show" award for "Can't Feel My Face," in which he was "talkin' 'bout a face numbin' off a bag of blow." The track actually lost to Adele's "Hello," but it clearly, somewhat comically, reached an unintended demographic. It comes as no surprise that Tesfaye, on his third proper album, doesn't attempt to optimize the reach of his biggest hit by consciously targeting youngsters. He sings of being a "Starboy" with access to a fleet of sports cars, but he's a "motherfuckin' starboy," one who is 26 years old and proud to observe his woman snort cocaine off his fancy table. While Starboy often reflects an increased opulence in the personal and professional aspects of Tesfaye's life -- from more upscale pronouns to expensive collaborations with the likes of Daft Punk (two) and "Can't Feel My Face" producers Max Martin and Ali Payami (four) -- the dark moments of vulnerability are pitch black. Lines like "I switch up my cup, I kill any pain" could have come from Tesfaye's mixtape debut, yet there are new levels of torment. In "Ordinary Life," he considers driving off a Mulholland Drive cliff, James Dean style, wishing he could swap everything for angel status. It's followed with "Nothing Without You," a ballad of toxic dysfunction. He asks his lover if she'd feel guilty for not answering his call if he happened to die that night. It's not all dread and depravity. There's some sense of joy in a one-night stand, and an echo of "Say Say Say" Michael Jackson, on the Luomo-ish house track "Rockin'." Contrition is shown in the slick retro-modern disco-funk of "A Lonely Night." Ironically enough, in the aching "True Colors," Tesfaye sounds a little insecure about a lover's past. The album's lighter, comparatively sweeter parts -- the Tears for Fears-sampling/Romantics-referencing "Secrets" and the breezy and only slightly devilish "I Feel It Coming" among them -- are all welcome highlights. At 18 tracks, the album is a "contracted edition" playlist toolkit. The songwriting credits list just under 40 composers, and the productions -- the majority of which involve Doc McKinney and/or Cirkut, low-lighted by maneater dance-punk dud "False Alarm" -- are roughly as variable in style as they are in quality. When pared down to its ten best songs, Starboy sounds like Tesfaye's most accomplished work.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	17	CD	2026-01-18 21:56:02.965949	2

Not coincidentally, she didn't lack for attention leading up to the release of her Interscope debut, Born to Die. The hype began in mid-2011 with a stunning song and video for "Video Games," and it kept on rising, right up to her January 2012 performance on Saturday Night Live (making her the first artist since Natalie Imbruglia in 1998 to perform on SNL without an album available). Although it's easy to see the reasons why Del Rey got her contract, it's also easy to hear: her songwriting skills and her bewitching voice. "Video Games" is a beautiful song, calling to mind Fiona Apple and Anna Calvi as she recounts another variation on the age-old trope of female-as-sex-object. Her vacant, tired reading of the song rescues it from any hint of exploitation, making it a winner. Unfortunately, the only problem with Born to Die is a big one. There is a chasm that separates "Video Games" from the other material and performances on the album, which aims for exactly the same target -- sultry, sexy, wasted -- but with none of the same lyrical grace, emotional power, or sympathetic productions. Del Rey doesn't mind taking chances, varying her vocalizing and delivery, toying with her lines and reaching for cinematic flourishes ("he loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart," "Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice"), and even attempting to rap. But she's unable to consistently sell herself as a heartbreaker, and most of the songs here sound like cobbled retreads of "Video Games." An intriguing start, but Del Rey is going to have to hit the books if she wants to stay as successful as her career promised early on.© John Bush /TiVo	11	CD	2026-01-18 21:56:06.039972	2
769019	Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Blvd	Lana Del Rey	47.53	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/ia/j7/nrm4neq8hj7ia_600.jpg	qobuz:203578463|nrm4neq8hj7ia	We can’t say we didn’t know that there’s a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard. Just as we can’t dispute that Lana Del Rey has become (or has always been, for those who had already figured this out) an essential figure in American music. With this ninth album with such a long title, Lana Del Rey remains in her Californian Ophelia character, floating tragically and romantically on the surface of a Hollywood pool. Her songs are slow and rather long, often devoid of choruses or pop gimmicks. Her sensual yet detached vocals are enhanced by minimalist arrangements with most of the songs having a few piano notes and even a few strings. Melancholy is a solitary pleasure, a way of living or at least not dying, in which Lana Del Rey is an expert. It seems that since 2021, and the Chemtrails Over the Country Club album, the singer has had long COVID. Although this languishing vibe is something that has been present in her music for much longer. On the surface there’s lethargy and introspection, even monotony because of the album’s 16-track length, but there’s no disappointment to be found here. It’s a record that you can listen to in private, ideally without disturbance. It leads you down a tunnel which, under the surface, is full of twists and turns, grey areas, echoes and suggestions. The signature track is A&W, which begins as a simple folk ballad and shifts into the realms of experimental hip-hop in the middle. When she lends herself to contemporary pop infused with hip-hop, Lana Del Rey has the good sense not to abuse her craft, to steer her voice clear of autotune. She is a singer whose name belongs among the greats (in no particular order: Kate Bush, Fiona Apple, Carole King, Laura Nyro, Agnes Obel, Joni Mitchell etc.) but who digs tunnels to escape – or hide. © Stéphane Deschamps/Qobuz	20	CD	2026-01-18 21:56:06.039976	2

Elizabeth Grant, aka Lana Del Rey, could sing the instruction manual for a wireless vacuum cleaner and she would still have our full attention. Even when she invites the whole world to join her (A$AP Rocky, The Weeknd, Stevie Nicks and Sean Lennon all featured on Lust For Life, her album released in 2017), she lives in her own little world where time moves slow and melancholy reigns supreme. Making music is her way of talking about her era, her contemporaries, the American Dream and, as far as we can tell, herself... With its shocking title, stylised album cover (featuring Duke Nicholson, Jack Nicholson’s grandson, aboard a boat sailing away from a burning coast) and her particularly slow tempos (only ballads here), Norman Fucking Rockwell! is largely rooted in folk. Del Rey roams around this great soundscape, more melancholic and evanescent than ever. She closely collaborated with Jack Antonoff on this album (a sought-after producer for pop stars such as Taylor Swift, St. Vincent, Lorde, Carly Rae Jepsen and Pink) and the producer shapes her melancholy with equal amounts of sobriety and slickness. The slow rhythms on this beautiful record offer a welcome break from the turbulence of today. One of the tracks that stands out is a cover of Sublime’s Doin’ Time (1996), itself a new interpretation of Gershwin’s Summertime, offering further proof of Lana Del Rey’s originality, something which is much more complex than some would have us believe... © Marc Zisman/Qobuz	34	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:18.428519	1

The voice is magnetic, more sensual than ever; the melodies are solid. If through the eyes of Lana, the world stays affected, slow and pensive, the skillfully chosen featuring tracks offer a few welcome respites. Thereby, the baby doll has invited a few friends to her ball. A$ap Rocky officiates on Groupie Love and Summer Bummer—in which he brings with him Atlanta’s wild youngster, Playboi Carti—The Weeknd on Lust for Life, Jonathan Wilson on Love. Others, and not least among them, have joined the party. Stevie Nicks, Fleetwood Mac’s emblematic singer, pops by on Beautiful People Beautiful Problems, and Sean Ono Lennon on Tomorrow Never Came. 16 tracks, 72 minutes. It’s a mix of genres ranging from hip hop with trap accents to psychedelic, without forgetting ballads on piano, and always a focus on acoustic. It’s a passionate craving for life then, which comes back to the one that has made her queen, Born to Die. It’s almost ironic. Has it gone back full circle? Anyway, this faded color melancholy is as attractive as ever, and its varnish doesn’t only crack to reveal the throes of an idol anymore, but also to tackle a modern America in disarray, between past and future. © MD/Qobuz	19	CD	2026-01-18 21:56:18.428523	2

Over the course of three albums, Lana Del Rey hasn't so much expanded her delicately sculpted persona as she has refined it, removing anything extraneous to her exquisite ennui. Honeymoon doesn't drift or float, it marks time, sometimes swelling with a suggestion of impending melodrama but often deflating to just an innervated pulse. Apart from the syncopated chorus on "High on the Beach," any lingering element of the hip-hop affectations of Born to Die have been banished and so have the shade and light Dan Auerbach brought to Ultraviolence, a record that feels cinematic in comparison to Honeymoon. What's left behind is the essence of Lana Del Rey: iconic images of days of Los Angeles passed, all plasticized and stylized, functioning as lighthouses in stoned, sad daydreams. Mood reigns over all on Honeymoon -- melodies and tempos certainly aren't prioritized over feel; all the originals are purposefully languid, which is partially why the Nancy Sinatra sample on "Terrence Loves You" and "Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood," a cover allegedly in the vein of Nina Simone's original but bearing an organ out of the Animals, stick -- but underneath the dragging beats and austere arrangements, there's something approaching triumph. Where Lana Del Rey seemed weighted down by existential sorrow on her first two albums, Honeymoon seems comfortingly melancholic and that's the truest sign that it is the fullest execution of Lana Del Rey's grand plan yet.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	13	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:18.428523	1

With Chemtrails Over the Country Club, her pop is folkier than ever, although the echo and reverb in which her exquisite, sensual and hypnotic voice basks set her high above the clouds. This folk idiom fascinates her to the point that she closes out this record (with some help from Natalie Mering aka Weyes Blood and Zella Day) with a magnificent cover of Joni Mitchell's For Free, taken from her album Ladies of the Canyon (1970). There are also those guitars with an air of the Laurel Canyon 70's scene about them on Not All Who Wander Are Lost, and the equally pure guitar sounds that open Yosemite. As usual, Lana Del Rey takes out her pen to decry the torments of celebrity and the star system, starting with White Dress which opens the album, regretting the good old days when she was a barmaid, unknown and listening to Sun Ra, Kings Of Leon and the White Stripes "when they were white hot". Further on, she offers up more references to the music history as on Breaking Up Slowly (a duet with Nikki Lane) where she addresses the marital storms between those two legends of country music, Tammy Wynette and George Jones. On song after song, this solitary amazon soldiers on, not battling for any particular cause, just doing what is right by her own lights ("Well, I don't care what they think. Drag racing my little red sports car. I'm not unhinged or unhappy, I'm just wild"). Chemtrails Over the Country Club shows above all that she excels in the art of storytelling, wielding her tweezers to fine-tune every detail of her lyrics. At 35, Lana Del Rey has arguably released her freest and most accomplished album. © Marc Zisman/Qobuz	33	CD	2026-01-18 21:56:18.428523	2

It's fascinating how the LA-based New Yorker can cut right through the dense trappings of her image (the pout, the persona, the videos, etc.) and put the spotlight firmly on her songs. Once again, amid quiet intimacy, boudoir melodies and confessional arrangements, the American shines as a songwriter of substance. The pop music on Chemtrails Over the Country Club, was folkier than ever, despite the echo and reverb that helped her exquisite voice really soar. But here she takes a more eclectic approach and makes a few nods to her previous songs. Some of the songs here were originally written for previous albums, which is another reason for the sometimes-baffling eclecticism of Blue Banisters or maybe it's just a true reflection of her personality?The "confessions of a bad girl" song is still her strong suit (Black Bathing Suit), but Del Rey can still pull out the drama, for example in her duet with Miles Kane (Dealer); and she can even manage some family-friendly material, as with Sweet Carolina, which was co-written with her father and sister. She slaloms between textures and sounds, outpourings and outbursts. Hypnotised, we can only follow... We leave Blue Banisters with less the impression of having travelled in unknown land, as with the deep conviction that we now hold in our hands a new, crucial piece of the Lana Del Rey puzzle. This record offers yet more proof that melancholy and the blues are still the most efficient fuel for songwriting... © Marc Zisman/Qobuz	39	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:18.428524	1
463651	Born To Die – Paradise Edition	Lana Del Rey	130.47	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/sc/9u/cbu9upfsa9usc_600.jpg	qobuz:92622498|cbu9upfsa9usc	Lana Del Rey is a femme fatale with a smoky voice, a languorous image, and a modeling contract. Not coincidentally, she didn't lack for attention leading up to the release of her Interscope debut, Born to Die. The hype began in mid-2011 with a stunning song and video for "Video Games," and it kept on rising, right up to her January 2012 performance on Saturday Night Live (making her the first artist since Natalie Imbruglia in 1998 to perform on SNL without an album available). Although it's easy to see the reasons why Del Rey got her contract, it's also easy to hear: her songwriting skills and her bewitching voice. "Video Games" is a beautiful song, calling to mind Fiona Apple and Anna Calvi as she recounts another variation on the age-old trope of female-as-sex-object. Her vacant, tired reading of the song rescues it from any hint of exploitation, making it a winner. Unfortunately, the only problem with Born to Die is a big one. There is a chasm that separates "Video Games" from the other material and performances on the album, which aims for exactly the same target -- sultry, sexy, wasted -- but with none of the same lyrical grace, emotional power, or sympathetic productions. Del Rey doesn't mind taking chances, varying her vocalizing and delivery, toying with her lines and reaching for cinematic flourishes ("he loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart," "Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice"), and even attempting to rap. But she's unable to consistently sell herself as a heartbreaker, and most of the songs here sound like cobbled retreads of "Video Games." An intriguing start, but Del Rey is going to have to hit the books if she wants to stay as successful as her career promised early on.© John Bush /TiVo	8	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:18.428524	1

938691	GNX	Kendrick Lamar	396	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/3b/rj/n9dqr0t48rj3b_600.jpg	qobuz:302791418|n9dqr0t48rj3b	Of all the facets of his artistry, Kendrick Lamar possesses two crucial strengths that, in tandem, spark a compelling struggle. One is his formidable ability, per hip-hop's tradition, of savvily synthesizing multiple generations' worth of musical and cultural influence to speak to the present through the past. The other is a tendency to interrogate himself over the ensuing internal contradictions that result from this. As an MC from a generation that was catalyzed by 2Pac, Nas, and OutKast, and then set about embodying those artists' own personal turmoil through creative restlessness, Kendrick's ability to thrive on conflict includes the ones that arise within himself. GNX was dropped out of nowhere in the waning weeks of a 2024 that was already under his command—the realm of a man who, at least for the time being, had summoned an incandescent haterism to dethrone one of pop music's most dominant forces of the last fifteen years. But this album isn't a simple turbocharged victory lap in a Reagan-era muscle car.After sharpening his steel against Drake, Lamar's blade turns inwards, even as he glowers at the peers who frustrate him while he wields it. He kicks off in the mode of an embattled artist who feels under-respected in "wacced out murals" and uses that bitterness to fuel the individualistic chest-pounding of "squabble up"'s freestyle-goes-Zapp elasticity, front-loading the album with a brittle-edged and deceptively indulgent ego trip that culminates in the entitlement-justifying I deserve it all grasp of "man at the garden." It's in the conceptual insight of "reincarnated" that he questions all this—his role as an artist struggling with the pull between his ego, the power the music business has given him, and the effect his work has on its listeners. From there it's a different kind of confidence. "tv off" rattles with a demand for tougher competition as though he's warding off his own complacency, "dodger blue" and the title cut lift up the city and the potential rap heirs that he maintains strong ties to, and "heart pt. 6" serves as a reflective reminder of the come-up that put him on the road to where he is today. As pure music, GNX is resonant in both its familiarity and its boldness: Sounwave's expansive palette infuses the album's retrofuture g-funk with slow jams ("luther"), hyphy ("peekaboo"), chillwave ("dodger blue"), and the in-the-air-tonight minimalism of Nas's "One Mic" ("man at the garden"); between that and Mustard's instantly-legendary "Not Like Us"-redux "tv off" it's even possible to forget Jack Antonoff's hand in it. And there's a real dynamism when it's paired with the stylistic malleability of Lamar's own flows—whether it's the self-interrogation of "reincarnated," the Drakeo the Ruler stylistic tribute on "hey now," or the melodic lilt of SZA-featuring state-of-his-art closer "gloria." GNX is the sound of a man looking for a resolution, something to tie all the loose ends together and show him and his art form a possible new escape route out from an encroaching disillusionment. © Nate Patrin/Qobuz	13	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:20.99281	1
843955	DAMN.	Kendrick Lamar	91.2	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/71/08/0060255760871_600.jpg	qobuz:40128300|0060255760871	To Pimp a Butterfly's proper and oft-biblical follow-up arrived on Good Friday, 13 months after untitled unmastered., an intermediary release that eclipsed the best work of most contemporary artists. If Kendrick Lamar felt pressure to continue living up to his previous output, there's no evidence on DAMN. He's too occupied tracing the spectrum of his mental states, from "boxin' demons" to "flex on swole," questioning and reveling in his affluence, castigating and celebrating his bloodline, humble enough to relate his vulnerabilities, assured enough to proclaim "Ain't none of y'all fuckin' with the flow." Throughout, he intensely examines most of the seven deadly sins, aware all along that his existence is threatened by anyone who objects to the color of his skin or clothes -- or, in the case of the blind stranger who shoots him during the album's opener, nothing that is apparent. Compared to the maximum-capacity, genre-twisting vastness and winding narratives of Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City and To Pimp a Butterfly, DAMN. on the surface seems like a comparatively simple rap album that demands less from the listener. There's relative concision in the track titles and material, and a greater emphasis on commercial sounds -- such as Mike WiLL's lean and piano-laced trap beat for the strong-arming "HUMBLE.," Lamar's first Top Ten pop hit, and a couple productions that are merely functional backdrops lacking distinction. In a way, however, DAMN. is just as lavish and singular as the preceding albums, its quantity and weight of thoughts and connected concepts condensed into a considerably tighter space. It contains some of Lamar's best writing and performances, revealing his evolving complexity and versatility as a soul-baring lyricist and dynamic rapper. Although it's occasionally distorted, stretched, smeared, and reversed to compelling and imagination-fueling effect, his voice is at its most affecting in its many untreated forms. Take "FEAR.," in which he switches between echoing hot-blooded parental threats to enumerating, with a 40-acre stare, various death scenarios. His storytelling hits an astonishing new high on "Duckworth," the album's finale. Over ethereal funk sewn by 9th Wonder, Lamar details a potentially tragic encounter between his father and future Top Dawg CEO Anthony Tiffith -- and the conditions leading to it -- that occurred long before Kung Fu Kenny was known as K. Dot.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	14	CD	2026-01-18 21:56:34.711433	2

Anguish and despair rightfully earn more Grammys, Emmys, Tonys, and Pulitzer Prizes than sweetness and light ever do, but West Coast rapper Kendrick Lamar is already on elevated masterwork number two, so expect his version of the sobering truth to sound like a party at points. He's aware, as Bilal sings here, that "Shit don't change 'til you get up and wash your ass," and don't it feel good? The sentiment is universal, but the viewpoint on his second LP is inner-city and African-American, as radio regulars like the Isley Brothers (sampled to perfection during the key track "I"), George Clinton (who helps make "Wesley's Theory" a cross between "Atomic Dog" and Dante's Inferno), and Dr. Dre (who literally phones his appearance in) put the listener in Lamar's era of Compton, just as well as Lou Reed took us to New York and Brecht took us to Weimar Republic Berlin. These G-funky moments are incredibly seductive, which helps usher the listener through the album's 80-minute runtime, plus its constant mutating (Pharrell productions, spoken word, soul power anthems, and sound collages all fly by, with few tracks ending as they began), much of it influenced, and sometimes assisted by, producer Flying Lotus and his frequent collaborator Thundercat. "u" sounds like an MP3 collection deteriorating, while the broken beat of the brilliant "Momma" will challenge the listener's balance, and yet, Lamar is such a prodigiously talented and seductive artist, his wit, wisdom, and wordplay knock all these stray molecules into place. Survivor's guilt, realizing one's destiny, and a Snoop Dogg performance of Doggystyle caliber are woven among it all; plus, highlights offer that Parliament-Funkadelic-styled subversion, as "The Blacker the Berry" ("The sweeter the juice") offers revolutionary slogans and dips for the hip. Free your mind, and your ass will follow, and at the end of this beautiful black berry, there's a miraculous "talk" between Kendrick and the legendary 2Pac, as the brutalist trailblazer mentors this profound populist. To Pimp a Butterfly is as dark, intense, complicated, and violent as Picasso's Guernica, and should hold the same importance for its genre and the same beauty for its intended audience.© David Jeffries /TiVo	16	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:34.711438	1
471311	Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers (Explicit version)	Kendrick Lamar	85.15	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/fc/tl/bol3685y6tlfc_600.jpg	qobuz:159327762|bol3685y6tlfc	As early as his first official studio release, 2011’s Section.80, Kendrick Lamar’s albums have been intricate and conceptual, constructed more like ambitious theatrical narratives than mere collections of songs. Fifth album Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers follows this trajectory as a double-album’s worth of interconnecting statements that are relentlessly complex, emotionally dense, and sometimes uncomfortably raw. Unlike the lush, spacious sonics of DAMN. or the life-affirming funk of To Pimp a Butterfly, Mr. Morale is scattered both in terms of musical approaches and lyrical perspectives. The album’s first half is particularly messy, with themes of trauma, grief, society, and Kendrick’s own uneasy relationship with fame all overlapping. His technical abilities are stunning and versatile as ever, but the frantic flows and jarring beat switches of “United in Grief” begin an angsty catharsis that runs throughout many of the tracks. “N95” is a seething cultural critique where Lamar spits bile in multiple directions over a bleakly catchy, bass-driven instrumental. Issues with lust addiction and infidelity are put under a microscope on the tense and minimal “Worldwide Steppers,” and Lamar depicts his troubled relationship with his father in painful detail on “Father Time,” which features a gorgeous vocal performance by Sampha on the hook. There’s further exploration of deeply personal family history on “Auntie Diaries,” which chronicles Lamar coming to understand the experiences two of his relatives had with transitioning gender identities. Throughout the album he funnels all of these experiences inward, seeking to grow through his own changes and the changes he sees around him. This shows up as a dismissal of celebrity on “Rich Spirit” or as striving for self-acceptance on “Count Me Out.” The album’s quick musical and thematic shifts can make for an uneven flow. The floating R&B instrumental and tender introspection of “Die Hard” come just a few tracks before cacophonous swirls of piano on “Rich - Interlude” and the jagged cosmic hip-hop of Ghostface Killah and Summer Walker collaboration “Purple Hearts.” The album’s intensity reaches a full boil on “We Cry Together,” a song that sounds like live audio footage of the most vicious couple’s argument imaginable, and reaches the same levels of ugliness as Eminem’s “Kim,” a clear reference point. As always, the production is immaculate and Lamar is joined by a host of industry giants, with contributions coming from Baby Keem, Thundercat, and even a vocal cameo from Portishead’s Beth Gibbons on the stunning sadness of “Mother I Sober.” While not as immediately accessible as some of the work that came before it, there’s value in both the harrowing and enlightening moments here. Lamar puts everything on the table with Mr. Morale & the Big Steppers, trying to get closer to his unfiltered personal truth, and creating some of his most challenging, expectation-defying work in the process. While not always an easy listen, the album shows more of its intention as it goes, and ultimately makes sense as the next logical step forward in Lamar’s increasingly multi-dimensional artistic evolution.© Fred Thomas /TiVo	15	CD	2026-01-18 21:56:34.711439	2
173146	Black Panther The Album Music From And Inspired By (Explicit)	Kendrick Lamar	232	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/uc/zv/t8mxqwslrzvuc_600.jpg	qobuz:47263278|t8mxqwslrzvuc	This is more than we'd bargained for: to accompany the cinema release of the Marvel/Disney blockbuster Black Panther, here is a soundtrack put together by Kendrick Lamar (and his label TDE) which was anything but an afterthought. While a quick look at the track list shows that Kendrick only features on three tracks (the sharp Black Panther, the sure-fire hit All The Stars with protégée SZA and Big Shot), it seems that Lamar has co-composed, co-written and co-produced most of the others - proof, were it required, that he is far from being just one of modern rap's most spectacular performers. To round the whole thing off, he takes the mic on several other artists' tracks, most notably on the epic closing piece Pray for Me, with The Weekend.   As for the cast, alongside collaborators Schoolboy Q, Ab-Soul, Jay Rock and SZA, stars like The Weekend, Khalid and Vince Staples (there's even Future, Travis Scott and James Blake waiting in the wings), Lamar shines a spotlight on several unknowns, whose names will surely soon be cropping up on our screens. That includes the Californian group SOB x RBE who keep alive the spirit of Vallejo, hometown of legends E-40 and Mac Dre (Paramedic!) and South Africa's Babes Wodumo, a figure in the Gqom tendency which is all the rage in Durban and is starting to move feet in Paris and Berlin (on Redemption, with Zacari for whom Kendrick has already done the honours on DAMN.).   Black Panther The Album is a laboratory for Kendrick Lamar (he uses it to test new formulas, from the underground of South Africa's townships to the Sacramento projects), a manifesto (the opportunity of the "black blockbuster" as a pulpit for his message was too good to miss) and as a billboard (he invites a whole flock of disciples with more than a nod at Kanye West). It's a hat trick - hats off! © DB/Qobuz	39	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:34.711439	1
931970	good kid, m.A.A.d city	Kendrick Lamar	118.3	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/7b/xr/tmtynwrp5xr7b_600.jpg	qobuz:54322296|tmtynwrp5xr7b	Hip-hop debuts don't come much more "highly anticipated" than Kendrick Lamar's. A series of killer mixtapes displayed his talent for thought-provoking street lyrics delivered with an attention-grabbing flow, and then there was his membership in the Black Hippy crew with his brethren Ab-Soul, Schoolboy Q, and Jay Rock all issuing solo releases that pleased the "true hip-hop" set, setting the stage for a massive fourth and final. Top it off with a pre-release XXL Magazine cover that he shared with his label boss and all-around legend Dr. Dre, and the "biggest debut since Illmatic" stuff starts to flow, but Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City would be a milestone even without the back-story, offering cool and compelling lyrics, great guests (Drake, Dr. Dre, and MC Eiht) and attractive production (from Pharrell, Just Blaze, Tabu, and others). Here, Kendrick is living his life like status and cash were extra credit. It is what makes this kid so "good" as he navigates his "mad" city (Compton) with experience and wisdom beyond his years (25). He's shamelessly bold about the allure of the trap, contrasting the sickness of his city with the universal feeling of getting homesick, and carrying a Springsteen-sized love for the home team. Course, in his gang-ruled city, N.W.A. was the home team, but as the truly beautiful, steeped-in-soul, biographic key track "The Art of Peer Pressure" finds a reluctant young Kendrick and his friends feeding off the life-force of Young Jeezy's debut album, it's something Clash, Public Enemy, and all other rebel music fans can relate to. Still, when he realizes that hero Jeezy must have risen above the game -- because the real playas are damned and never show their faces -- it spawns a kind of elevated gangsta rap that's as pimp-connectable as the most vicious Eazy-E, and yet poignant enough to blow the dust off any cracked soul. Equally heavy is the cautionary tale of drank dubbed "Swimming Pools," yet that highlight is as hooky and hallucinatory as most Houston drank anthems, and breaks off into one of the chilling, cassette-quality interludes that connect the album, adding to the documentary or eavesdropping quality of it all. Soul children will experience déjà vu when "Poetic Justice" slides by with its Janet Jackson sample -- sounding like it came off his Aunt's VHS copy of the movie it's named after -- while the closing "Compton" is an anthem sure to make the Game jealous, featuring Dre in beast mode, acting pre-Chronic and pre-Death Row. This journey through the concrete jungle of Compton is worth taking because of the artistic richness within, plus the attraction of a whip-smart rapper flying high during his rookie season. Any hesitation about the horror of it all is quickly wiped away by Kendrick's mix of true talk, open heart, open mind, and extended hand. Add it all up and even without the hype, this one is still potent and smart enough to rise to the top of the pile.© David Jeffries /TiVo	34	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:34.71144	1

579242	untitled unmastered.	Kendrick Lamar	155.2	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/63/51/0060254785163_600.jpg	qobuz:30623384|0060254785163	Issued without advance notice 17 days after Kendrick Lamar's riveting 2016 Grammy Awards performance, untitled unmastered. consists of eight demos that are simply numbered and dated. Apart from segments previewed at the Grammys and late-night television appearances, there was no formal promotion. A postscript, it's (artfully) artless in presentation -- not even basic credits appear on the Army green liner card in the compact disc edition -- yet it's almost as lyrically and musically rich as To Pimp a Butterfly. The dates indicate that the majority of the material was made during the sessions for that album, and the presence of many of its players and vocalists is unmistakable. This was assembled with a high level of care that is immediately evident, its components sequenced to foster an easy listen. Track-to-track flow, however, is about the only aspect of this release that can be called smooth. After an intimate spoken intro from Bilal, the set segues into an urgent judgment-day scenario with squealing strings and a resounding bassline as Lamar confronts mortality and extinction with urgent exasperation. He observes terrifying scenes all the while sensing possible relief ("No more running from world wars," "No more discriminating the poor"). untitled unmastered. offers this and other variations on the connected themes of societal ills, faith, and survival that drove the output it follows, with Lamar at his best when countering proudly materialistic boasts with ever-striking acknowledgments of the odds perilously weighted against his people. Remarkably, this hits its stride in the second half. The stretch involves a rolling, ornamented retro-contemporary production from Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammad (with vocal assists from Bilal and Cee Lo Green), a stitched suite that is alternately stern and humorously off the cuff (featuring Egypt, five-year-old son of Alicia Keys and Swizz Beatz, as co-producer and vocalist), and a finale of Thundercat-propelled funk. Even while coasting over the latter's breezy and smacking groove, Lamar fills the space with meaning, detailing a confrontation with sharp quips and stinging reprimands. While Lamar referred to these tracks as demos, and not one of them has the pop-soul appeal of "These Walls" or the Black Lives Matter protest-anthem potential of "Alright," untitled unmastered. is no mere offcut dump. It's as vital as anything else its maker has released.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	31	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:34.711442	1
804468	good kid, m.A.A.d city	Kendrick Lamar	133.3	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/xa/bh/byymwqhtabhxa_600.jpg	qobuz:54293125|byymwqhtabhxa	Hip-hop debuts don't come much more "highly anticipated" than Kendrick Lamar's. A series of killer mixtapes displayed his talent for thought-provoking street lyrics delivered with an attention-grabbing flow, and then there was his membership in the Black Hippy crew with his brethren Ab-Soul, Schoolboy Q, and Jay Rock all issuing solo releases that pleased the "true hip-hop" set, setting the stage for a massive fourth and final. Top it off with a pre-release XXL Magazine cover that he shared with his label boss and all-around legend Dr. Dre, and the "biggest debut since Illmatic" stuff starts to flow, but Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City would be a milestone even without the back-story, offering cool and compelling lyrics, great guests (Drake, Dr. Dre, and MC Eiht) and attractive production (from Pharrell, Just Blaze, Tabu, and others). Here, Kendrick is living his life like status and cash were extra credit. It is what makes this kid so "good" as he navigates his "mad" city (Compton) with experience and wisdom beyond his years (25). He's shamelessly bold about the allure of the trap, contrasting the sickness of his city with the universal feeling of getting homesick, and carrying a Springsteen-sized love for the home team. Course, in his gang-ruled city, N.W.A. was the home team, but as the truly beautiful, steeped-in-soul, biographic key track "The Art of Peer Pressure" finds a reluctant young Kendrick and his friends feeding off the life-force of Young Jeezy's debut album, it's something Clash, Public Enemy, and all other rebel music fans can relate to. Still, when he realizes that hero Jeezy must have risen above the game -- because the real playas are damned and never show their faces -- it spawns a kind of elevated gangsta rap that's as pimp-connectable as the most vicious Eazy-E, and yet poignant enough to blow the dust off any cracked soul. Equally heavy is the cautionary tale of drank dubbed "Swimming Pools," yet that highlight is as hooky and hallucinatory as most Houston drank anthems, and breaks off into one of the chilling, cassette-quality interludes that connect the album, adding to the documentary or eavesdropping quality of it all. Soul children will experience déjà vu when "Poetic Justice" slides by with its Janet Jackson sample -- sounding like it came off his Aunt's VHS copy of the movie it's named after -- while the closing "Compton" is an anthem sure to make the Game jealous, featuring Dre in beast mode, acting pre-Chronic and pre-Death Row. This journey through the concrete jungle of Compton is worth taking because of the artistic richness within, plus the attraction of a whip-smart rapper flying high during his rookie season. Any hesitation about the horror of it all is quickly wiped away by Kendrick's mix of true talk, open heart, open mind, and extended hand. Add it all up and even without the hype, this one is still potent and smart enough to rise to the top of the pile.© David Jeffries /TiVo	18	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:34.711443	1

The Compton native wasn't descending from the mountain to deliver shrouded statement pieces and orchestrated opuses -- he was battering Drake in lived hours, "put[ting] one hundred hoods on one stage," headlining America's most celebrated sporting event. Capping the year off with a focused set of West Coast scorchers, his surprise sixth set, GNX, sees the rapper embrace being the moment; this is lightning-in-a-bottle Kendrick. GNX's first order is to yank rap back to its regional roots: the album's sound is as L.A. as "California Love" or a Toddy Tee cassette. The driving heart of the record is the regional bounce retooled for "Not Like Us," which forms the anthemic trinity of "squabble up," "hey now," and "tv off." With the stamp of authenticity -- "teleport to Bullets Road and dig up all my relatives" -- he digs sparse, fresh tracks through the sound alongside the unlikely Jack Antonoff; "hey now" captures the ghost of a stadium roar, "gnx" upturns its off-kilter pianos and basses, and "wacced out murals" plays like the child of Yeezus with metallic sirens and ravenous silences. Kendrick, running in tandem with a pack of L.A. up-and-comers, speaks with the chest-fire abandon of his city, firing off at will while still leaving room for the reflective "heart pt. 6" and "gloria." If Mr. Morale postured Kendrick in absolution -- "I am not your saviour" -- then GNX is a staggering rekindling of the "King Kunta" flame: "Who put the West back in front of shit? Tell 'em Kendrick did it" he spits on "gnx," before inviting Peysoh and Hitta J3 up to bat. He's "prophetic" and "the greatest of all time" -- a visioned torchbearer for the culture. And he's not the only one to feature here. On "reincarnated," Kendrick continues his storied engagement with the figurehead of Tupac Shakur, wearing the rapper's vocal style like a spiritual shawl over a flip of "Made N*****" as he slots his soul into the lives of Billie Holiday and John Lee Hooker. Deyra Barrera's searching vocal snippet -- the project's conceptual through-line -- seats Kendrick next to Anita Baker; there are eyebrows raised at Lil Wayne and Snoop, harmonic connections with SZA, and memories of wanting to flow like Soulo. And for every face named there's another unspoken -- new flows from Drakeo and Keek, the blueprints of Nipsey and Mac Dre, the spirit of Nas on the "One Mic"-like "man at the garden." It seems little coincidence that the concept of the album revolves around a black Buick GNX -- itself a literally "black" icon.Even when he's basking in triumph, Kendrick proves as complex as the present moment. Building a DAMN.-like skeleton from the kindlings of "The Heart Pt. 5," GNX is a pillar of reflective realness, a flag planted in the lineage of Black musical visionaries, a silhouette of the West Coast in the high beams of fame -- and Kendrick's most speaker-knocking set to date.© David Crone /TiVo	7	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:34.711444	1
638263	DAMN.	Kendrick Lamar	134.11	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/mc/ia/dj5s8rce5iamc_600.jpg	qobuz:51579269|dj5s8rce5iamc	To Pimp a Butterfly's proper and oft-biblical follow-up arrived on Good Friday, 13 months after untitled unmastered., an intermediary release that eclipsed the best work of most contemporary artists. If Kendrick Lamar felt pressure to continue living up to his previous output, there's no evidence on DAMN. He's too occupied tracing the spectrum of his mental states, from "boxin' demons" to "flex on swole," questioning and reveling in his affluence, castigating and celebrating his bloodline, humble enough to relate his vulnerabilities, assured enough to proclaim "Ain't none of y'all fuckin' with the flow." Throughout, he intensely examines most of the seven deadly sins, aware all along that his existence is threatened by anyone who objects to the color of his skin or clothes -- or, in the case of the blind stranger who shoots him during the album's opener, nothing that is apparent. Compared to the maximum-capacity, genre-twisting vastness and winding narratives of Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City and To Pimp a Butterfly, DAMN. on the surface seems like a comparatively simple rap album that demands less from the listener. There's relative concision in the track titles and material, and a greater emphasis on commercial sounds -- such as Mike WiLL's lean and piano-laced trap beat for the strong-arming "HUMBLE.," Lamar's first Top Ten pop hit, and a couple productions that are merely functional backdrops lacking distinction. In a way, however, DAMN. is just as lavish and singular as the preceding albums, its quantity and weight of thoughts and connected concepts condensed into a considerably tighter space. It contains some of Lamar's best writing and performances, revealing his evolving complexity and versatility as a soul-baring lyricist and dynamic rapper. Although it's occasionally distorted, stretched, smeared, and reversed to compelling and imagination-fueling effect, his voice is at its most affecting in its many untreated forms. Take "FEAR.," in which he switches between echoing hot-blooded parental threats to enumerating, with a 40-acre stare, various death scenarios. His storytelling hits an astonishing new high on "Duckworth," the album's finale. Over ethereal funk sewn by 9th Wonder, Lamar details a potentially tragic encounter between his father and future Top Dawg CEO Anthony Tiffith -- and the conditions leading to it -- that occurred long before Kung Fu Kenny was known as K. Dot.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	18	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:34.711445	1

839983	BRAT	Charli XCX	56.23	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/9b/75/capw1vifm759b_600.jpg	qobuz:270514771|capw1vifm759b	As a follow-up to the release of her most commercially successful album to date, 2022's Crash, Charli XCX could've easily followed the perfect-pop-pipeline, but instead she ended her contract and returned to her roots. With a sigh of relief from the hoard of fans she amassed over a 16-year career, the queen of MySpace and indie sleaze gave a middle finger to the execs and birthed brat. The era of chronically-online relatability has stars trying to prove they're just like their fans (despite obvious fame and fortune) but Charli XCX has embraced her pop icon status. She's not like you; she's a star, and she's earned it.brat was made for the pre-party, the club, and the stumble home. The mix of distorted bass, crunching percussion, pulsating beats, and frequent Auto-Tune transports you to the sticky, moist bathrooms of an East London venue, where music blares through paper-thin walls as groups of girls cram into single cubicles.Beyond the plaster walls of Charli's party palace lies a soft and vulnerable monarch at its centre. Tracks like "Sympathy is a knife," "I might say something stupid," and "Girl, so confusing" tackle surprisingly deep topics like the nuances of being a woman in a music industry where artists are frequently pitted against each other, the biological clock of motherhood ticking away, and the deep insecurities we all contemplate on the 5 a.m. bus ride home from the club with echoes of a 4/4 kick drum still throbbing in our head. brat's most touching moment comes on "So I," a heartbreaking track dedicated to the late artist SOPHIE, whose influence on Charli is evident throughout the album. (Cue the tears on the dancefloor.)In true party girl fashion, Charli ends on an upbeat note with "Mean girls" (sure to be a fan favourite) and "365," a propulsive, rave-ready take on the opening track "360," signalling that despite the tears, the party must go on.Charli XCX is a true tastemaker, as any It Girl should be, and the list of producers on brat should be enough to intrigue. At the helm of the project is her longtime collaborator A.G. Cook, the founder of the iconic PC Music label who is synonymous with hyperpop's popularity. Also in Charli's inner circle are UK producers Hudson Mohawke and Easyfun, as well as Gesaffelstein and Cirkut (who frequently works with Max Martin), who bring their unique presence to tie all of her intimate thoughts together with experimental flair in a perfectly underground-pop way that can only now be described as "so Charli."  Her creative world has always centered around a tight-knit circle of boundary-pushing artists; early collaborations have elevated future stars like Troye Sivan, Rina Sawayama, Kim Petras, Caroline Polachek, SOPHIE and MØ.  That communal feeling takes brat from a 9 to a 10.Making the album "the Charli Show" would've been easy—predictable of a popstar even—but instead brat feels like an intimate creative exchange among those shaping the future of music, a real insight into the minds of artists who are refreshingly on the same wavelength.brat is subversive; it's relevant; it's culturally "now." It exemplifies what happens when artists are allowed to thrive in their own world, free from decisions made by suits in boardrooms. Charli XCX has reclaimed her music. She's relatable. She's everywhere. (She's so Julia.) © Jess Porter-Langson/Qobuz	22	CD	2026-01-18 21:56:37.066967	2

The hyperactive English songwriter quickly set herself the challenge of writing an album from scratch in just six weeks and, most importantly, she made the project an interactive experience with her fans. While she was guided by industry titans such as A.G. Cook, (founder of the label PC Music) and BJ Burton (producer for Bon Iver and Miley Cyrus), everyone was invited to take part in the project. Some people sent her snippets of music while others gave their opinion on the demos she played on Instagram or the lyrics she posted on Twitter. She also organised Zoom conferences with hundreds of participants. The result is a pretty solid album by Charli XCX that remains faithful to the futuristic electronic pop sound that made her famous, with potential hit songs like the autotuned ballad Forever, the more dance-y Claws, as well as the lovely hybrid electro-pop song, I Finally Understand. And it seems like the artist may even carry on down that road: “I don’t know why I didn’t do it sooner!”. © Smaël Bouaici/Qobuz	10	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:49.45749	1

By capturing the mood of 2024 with Brat's hedonistic, witty, and heartbreaking songs, she went from an artist who, in her own words, was "almost famous, but not quite" to one with career-high chart positions in the U.K. and the U.S., an entire season devoted to her, and memes so popular they were adopted by national political campaigns. With brat and it's completely different but also still brat, xcx uses her success to continue Brat's no-holds-barred conversation about fame, feminism, friendship, creativity, and love by imbuing every track with more meaning and more viewpoints. These reworkings are more than just a bunch of features, though brat and it's completely different's guest list is impeccable. It's also studded with friends old and new: A.G. Cook joins xcx to revisit the heartfelt SOPHIE tribute "So I," paring it down to little more than fragments of wistful melody and haunting memories. Similarly, the years of friendship between xcx and Caroline Polachek can be felt on "Everything Is Romantic" as Polachek's silky vocals take the track's dreamy introspection to new heights. While nobody could have predicted a Charli xcx and Ariana Grande collaboration prior to Brat's release, the megastar's cameo feels perfectly natural on this version of "Sympathy Is a Knife," with the pair finding solidarity in dealing with impossible demands and beauty standards. Likewise, Lorde joins xcx in thwarting expectations of rivalry by working it out on the remix of "Girl, So Confusing," the Brat song she inspired. Arriving soon after Brat's first flush of praise, the prowling Billie Eilish team-up "Guess" feels like an outlier compared to the rest of brat and it's completely different's moodier tone, but it remains a standout and a vital part of the Brat story. For some of these more soul-baring remixes, Charli xcx enlists indie rock stalwarts from the 2000s and 2010s, providing a counterpoint to the electronic sounds of that era that fueled the original album. Julian Casablancas helps transform "Mean Girls" into a world-weary synth pop exploration of doomed relationships that's of a piece with his latter-day work with the Strokes and the Voidz; while Bon Iver steers "I Think About It All the Time" toward more conventional-sounding balladry, its mood still cuts to the bone. At its best, brat and it's completely different's numerous and varied collaborators reflect Charli xcx's grasp of pop music's history as well as how easily she moves between different creative circles. Robyn, the godmother of the candid, inventive pop xcx excels at, reminds listeners that she's been "killing this sh*t since 1994" on the pumping remix of "360." In turn, when xcx brings an up-and-coming artist like Spanish rapper bb trickz onto an even tighter incarnation of "Club Classics," it feels like she's passing the torch to the next generation. Much more than a victory lap, brat and it's completely different but also still brat enriches the Brat listening experience and the understanding of Charli xcx's artistry. Fans know she's deserved this level of acclaim for years, but the creativity and generosity on display here is more proof that it's high time the mainstream finally caught up to her.© Heather Phares /TiVo	39	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:49.457493	1
633564	Charli	Charli XCX	358.89	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/bc/d7/su5cchdpsd7bc_600.jpg	qobuz:62618373|su5cchdpsd7bc	During the five years between Sucker and her self-titled official third album, Charli XCX was busier than ever exploring the different sides of her music. Not only did she found her own label, Vroom Vroom, she wrote songs for and collaborated with a who's who of pop music. She also released two mixtapes, Number 1 Angel and Pop 2, that reflected her mercurial talent -- and her connections to pop's underground and mainstream -- better than either True Romance or Sucker did. With Charli, she attempts to capture the spontaneity of those releases in a more polished format; more often than not, she succeeds. This is especially true of the collaborations that dominate the album's first half, where she's joined by some of pop's best and brightest. "Gone," which teams Charli with Christine and the Queens, is a standout that combines the crisp, double-jointed synth pop of Chris with Charli's flair for pop fantasies into a bold '80s fever dream tailor-made for dance-offs. On "Cross You Out," Charli recruits Sky Ferreira, who expertly adds some extra drama to its hyperreal heartache. The album's timeliest assist comes from Lizzo, whose irrepressible cameo on "Blame It on Your Love" helps distinguish it from the many other tropical and dancehall-inspired songs released in the late 2010s. However, it's Charli's two songs with Troye Sivan that establish the album's sound and vision. On "1999," the duo delivers an unabashedly nostalgic love song to pop's past, singing the praises of Britney and Michael over brittle synths that evoke Max Martin's heyday; later, they close the album with "2099," a darkly gleaming track that, thanks to the fractured production of PC Music's AG Cook, sounds like the landing of a spaceship -- or a time machine. Cook and other members of the PC Music collective ensure that Charli never becomes too straightforward, particularly on "Shake It," which features frantically sloshing and clanking tones that match the feverish energy of Big Freedia, CupcakKe, Brooke Candy, and Pabllo Vittar. In comparison to the album's numerous collaborations, Charli's solo tracks feel separate, and sound much lonelier. Though "Thoughts" and "I Don't Wanna Know" prioritize a mood of late-night regret over hooks, Charli saves two of the album's best songs -- the bittersweet "White Mercedes" and the tentatively hopeful "Official" -- for herself. While Charli gives equal time to her pop bona fides and her experimental leanings in a way similar to Number 1 Angel or Pop 2, it doesn't always join these facets of her music as effortlessly. In a way, its unevenness is only fitting for an artist as committed to blurring pop's artistic boundaries and connecting the dots between its past, present, and future as she is -- that she's this hard to pin down this far into her career is exactly what makes her a continually intriguing talent.© Heather Phares /TiVo	13	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:49.457493	1

After co-writing and singing on Icona Pop's smash hit "I Love It," her album True Romance -- which had a darker, indie-friendly sound -- earned more acclaim than sales. Her next big break came with another collaboration, 2014's inescapable "Fancy," where she provided the sing-songy chorus to Iggy Azalea's brash verses. On Sucker, she keeps more of that hit-making swagger for herself, delivering attention-getting pop that's bold enough to ensure she isn't overshadowed by anybody. She makes her purpose clear with the album's title track, a musical middle finger to the clueless set to revved-up synths and stabbing guitars. It's a big change from the gothy pop of True Romance, though even on that album, XCX's hooks were undeniable. Sucker is also full of should-be hits, but these songs also show how creatively she fashions the shiniest parts of the '80s, '90s, 2000s, and 2010s into her own highly stylized sound. "Famous" bops along on a riff that nods to Cyndi Lauper's "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun"; there's a bit of Elastica in "Breaking Up"'s buzzsaw guitars and flirty put-downs; "Caught in the Middle" could be vintage Gwen Stefani; and "Doing It"'s retro dance-pop feels equally informed by XCX's own fascination with the '90s and HAIM's update on that decade. Similarly, Charli still exudes plenty of sass on Sucker, but the exact kind of attitude has changed. She retrofits some of True Romance's atmosphere on "Boom Clap," turning it into a sparkly anthem to young love that seems more innocent than it actually is. If she was trying to keep up with the hip kids before, now she sounds like an older sister sharing her tricks on "Break the Rules," where she's literally too cool for school. Anytime it feels like XCX may have oversimplified her sound -- like the notable absence of one of her finest singles, "Superlove" -- she proves otherwise. There's a realness to her writing no matter how shiny the album's surfaces are, and while these songs are influenced by the success she's had with others, she's saved her most personal songs for herself. It's hard to imagine any of her collaborators or contemporaries belting out a lyric like "When I'm driving down the wrong side of the road, I feel like JFK you know" with as much mischievous glee as Charli does on the standout "London Queen"; later, she states her independence, sexual and otherwise, on "Body of My Own." From song to song, she bounces from hanging out in her friends' bedroom to flying on private jets, making both sound like the coolest possible thing to do. Sucker's mix of youth and sophistication is more than a little volatile, and sometimes it feels like XCX is still figuring out what really works for her music. Nevertheless, it succeeds as an introduction to Charli XCX the Pop Star while retaining her whip-smart songwriting and attitude.© Heather Phares /TiVo	33	CD	2026-01-18 21:56:49.457495	2

758928	CRASH 	Charli XCX	171.13	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/ca/1d/ekkthkyni1dca_600.jpg	qobuz:150896727|ekkthkyni1dca	Reported to be her final album for Atlantic at the time of its release, Charli XCX embraces the idea of being a major-label pop artist to the fullest on Crash. For her, going mainstream is something of a daring move. Her previous album, 2020's Mercury Prize-longlisted how i'm feeling now, was one of her most experimental releases, its heartbroken hyperpop capturing the feeling of bouncing off the walls during the COVID-19 quarantine. That album (and her mixtapes) made a strong case for her more spontaneous releases being among her best, but the craft she applies to Crash isn't overdone. This is truly poptimist pop that consciously reframes the genre's past heyday as worthy of celebrating and updating. XCX grounds the album in the styles of the late '80s and early '90s and the late '90s and early 2000s -- eras when pop was highly produced but also highly creative. It's an aesthetic that suits Charli XCX well, especially on the bright, New Jack-jacking moves of "New Shapes," which features Caroline Polachek and Christine and the Queens, two other experts at giving a fresh context to vintage pop. On "Yuck," a charmingly disgusted rejection of lovey-dovey infatuation, XCX creates the perfect pastiche of late-'80s sounds, but she gets more literal on "Used to Know Me," which samples Robin S.'s 1993 earworm "Show Me Love"; on "Beg for You," a collaboration with Rina Sawayama, she folds in the massive hits "Cry for You" by September and "Don't Cry" by Milk Inc. Putting a boundary-pushing artist like Sawayama on one of Crash's most overtly retro songs feels like a missed opportunity, but "Beg for You"'s pulsing desperation is still a highlight that shows just how baked into pop's collective memory these decades-old songs still are. As she pays homage to pop music's past, XCX also borrows from her own. The way Crash takes inspiration from David Cronenberg's film of the same name echoes how she alluded to Quentin Tarantino's True Romance on her debut album, and the percolating death wish of the title track continues the car motif winding through her work since Icona Pop's "I Love It." The tweaked vocals on the slow-motion ballad "Move Me" recall the Charli highlight "Cross You Out," while "Good Ones" combines the self-defeating heartache that's been a key theme since her early days with the hooky songwriting that she's transformed into hits for others. Among all these revisitations of the past, Crash's concision feels new. On her other albums, XCX occasionally included so many songs that the great songs had to compete with the good ones for attention. At a sleek 33-minutes long, Crash lets songs like "Lightning" -- an unlikely but winning collision of freestyle beats, giddy orchestral synth stabs, and processed vocals -- claim the spotlight they deserve. It may not be quite as striking as how i'm feeling now, but on Crash, Charli XCX once again finds endless freedom in pop's constraints.© Heather Phares /TiVo	17	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:49.457496	1

LUX doesn’t ask for permission—it hypnotizes. The pulse ignites with "Berghain," the album's workhorse and pivotal piece, where the London Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Daníel Bjarnason, builds a framework in which the mystical and the carnal can coexist. "Berghain" not only sets the pulse—it establishes the melodic and rhythmic motifs that structure the album into four movements, acting as the axis that gives order to its journey.The album unfolds in four movements, playing like a ritualistic journey from start to finish, and physical editions feature 18 tracks (three exclusives) that extend this "ceremony." Around ROSALÍA is a chorus of collaborators: Björk and Yves Tumor on the border between club and oratorio; Estrella Morente, Silvia Pérez Cruz, and Carminho bringing flamenco, fado, and folk traditions; and L'Escolania de Montserrat and the Chamber Choir of the Palau de la Música Catalana anchoring the choral foundation—all nodding to the artist's Iberian roots.You can feel the conservatory discipline and the raw emotion: expansive strings, purposeful silences, and meticulous production alongside her trusted collaborators (Noah Goldstein, Dylan Wiggins/Sir Dylan, Jake Miller). LUX is both assertion and renewal—proud of its Spanish heritage, global in scope, bold without being flashy. It doesn't compete for attention; it creates its own space.This is an album ritual, meant to be heard in full from introspection to catharsis—a journey like a via crucis that ROSALÍA traces step by step in the "Berghain" music video. © Juan Barrios/Qobuz	23	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:56:52.837264	1

There are those who feared that once she signed to a major label, she would become nothing more than a Beyoncé spin-off,  however, Rosalia has proved them all wrong with this album that breaks the bonds of modern pop, mixing flamenco, salsa, bachata, hip-hop, soul and, of course, reggaeton.Rosalia, who claims to have listened to legends such as Ivy Queen and Don Omar whilst making this album, has really focussed on dembow. Reggaeton rhythm can be heard on half a dozen tracks, but it always deviates from the norm: an ultra-nervous electro bass on SAOKO, underwater vibes on CANDY, an industrial sound on CHICKEN TERIYAKI or superimposed 90’s synths on BIZCOCHITO. This album/mixtape is her most intimate yet, and Rosalia sings like never before, alternating solo piano and vocals with furious percussion, and she’s clearly drawn influence from Venezuelan musician Arca (CUUUUuuuuuute and HENTAI, produced by The Neptunes).

And yet, Rosalía Vila Tobella has made it work. Critics have been praising the Catalan for the “new flamenco” she developed on her 2017 Los Angeles album, and this year she shows no sign of slowing down. Since releasing Malamente, the contagious first track from El Mal Querer in May 2018, with a music video directed and produced by the Spanish group Canada, she has earned 5 nominations at the Latin Grammy Awards. And Rosalía is following up with yet more brilliance: featuring on J Balvin’s album Vibras, recording in the studio with Pharrell Williams and being called up for Pedro Almodovar’s next film… So here it is, the highly anticipated new album produced by El Guincho, a Spaniard signed by the English label Young Turks who has a passion for sampling tropical beats and enjoys cutting and pasting hand-claps, finger-clicks and sometimes Rosalía’s voice, as we hear on De Aqui No Sales, which is reminiscent of Björk’s work. Bagdad is a combination of R&B and flamenco, while there’s more of a shift towards electro on Que No Salga La Luna. The Spanish singer generally focuses on melody, though does at certain points divulge in more experimental sounds and it’s there that we see the more adventurous side of her phenomenal voice. © Smaël Bouaici/Qobuz	36	CD	2026-01-18 21:57:06.457328	2

This astonishing debut from a 23-year-old from Barcelona, on the other hand, manages to retain the music's primal emotion while sounding startlingly vital and accessible. Perhaps surprisingly, considering that Rosalía owes her growing reputation to collaborations with artists from other genres, including hip-hop and trap, Los Ángeles is a dyed-in-the-wool traditionalist flamenco album. As is customary for flamenco singers trying to make their name, Rosalía makes sure to demonstrate her mastery of all the different strands (or palos) of flamenco, such as alegrías, fandangos, tangos, tarantas, and malagueñas, among others. Despite this variety, Los Ángeles was ostensibly designed as a single piece with granite-like production consistency and arrangements as downright austere as the music is deadly serious. Death indeed hovers over almost every single lyric -- most culled from oral tradition or popular folk songs: Loss, murder, domestic abuse, exile, revenge, and suicide. More than just a solo album by Rosalía, however, Los Ángeles is a collaborative effort between the singer and maverick producer/guitarist Raül Refree, who has worked with Sonic Youth's Lee Ranaldo. While taking flamenco recordings and singers from the early 20th century as their points of departure, Rosalía and Refree also sound inspired by Johnny Cash and Rick Rubin's American Recordings series, a connection highlighted by the album's closer, a breathtakingly beautiful version of Will Oldham's "I See a Darkness" (also covered by Cash). In both attitude and sound, Los Ángeles could be considered flamenco with a D.I.Y.-post-punk ethos, something that can also be applied to Cash's American Recordings and Will Oldham's early Palace work. It certainly sounds just as revelatory. Of course, none of the above would make much of an impression in merely competent hands. As admirable as it may be as an art project, Los Ángeles is all about Rosalía's voice. No two ways about it: She is exceptional. No familiarity with the genre is required; her instrument is a tornado capable of sweeping away any cultural or language barriers. Even more remarkably, she does not accomplish this with sheer volume or vocal histrionics, but by reaching almost unbearable levels of intensity and expression. Universally hailed in Spain as one of 2017's best albums, Los Ángeles is a stellar debut that signals the appearance of a major talent in both the flamenco and the world music scene.© Mariano Prunes /TiVo	28	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:57:06.457332	1

After going viral at 18 for TikTok videos of her dancing to pop songs, she left college and signed with a mega talent agency, then co-hosted a podcast with her mom. A failed first single led her to debut EP being scrapped, but she launched perfume and cosmetic lines, tried her hand at acting and eventually released a few more songs to better reception. Then, in 2024, Charli XCX and A.G. Cook—the pop star and producer, respectively, of that summer—embraced Rae by featuring her on a remix of "Von dutch" and the song "Lucifer" from Cook's Britpop album. But it was Rae's own single, "Diet Pepsi," that finally hit big, creating a "What is that?!" moment. Suddenly, Addison Rae was taken seriously as more than just a novelty. The release of her debut album has her poised to be the girl of this summer, but the question still remains: Who, exactly, is she? Last year, we had Charli XCX's rule-breaking hedonism and Sabrina Carpenter's knowing pin-up wink and Chappell Roan's campy but poignant drag posture. Along with co-producers Luka Kloser and Elvira Anderfjärd—two relative unknowns (though Anderfjärd came up through the Max Martin system) who are the only producers and co-writers on all but one song on Addison—Rae seems to be still figuring herself out. Heavy-panting dance track "New York" borrows the house beats that propelled Charli's Brat. "Aquamarine" digs deeper into the past, specifically Ray of Light-era Madonna. Fun synth-popper "Fame Is a Gun" could be a retro Britney Spears track right down to the baby-doll vocals; not for nothing, Rae and Spears are both from small-town Louisiana and, as Rae sings here, "It never was enough/ I always wanted more." But the godmother of Addison is Lana del Rey circa 2012, when her Born to Die featured a song called "Diet Mountain Dew." Rae's memorable "Diet Pepsi" cracks the formula Lana perfected early on, mixing up alt-pop and trip-hop and a breathy sadcore sigh that Rae interprets as sex appeal. She coos and feathers her voice on the Lana-ish "Summer Forever" and dreams of "a cigarette pressed between my tits" on minor-chord-heavy "High Fashion." And Rae isn't hiding it. She name-checks Madonna, Lana and Gaga on appealingly weird, body-rolling "Money is Everything," which opens with her saying: "When I was growing up, Mama always told me to save my money/ So I never had to rely on a man to take care of me/ But money's not coming with me to heaven/ And I have a lot of it—so can't a girl just have fun?" She's kidding, right? Addison feels good, even if it's ephemeral as the AC blast you get walking into H&M on a hot day. © Shelly Ridenour/Qobuz	19	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:57:09.11994	1

It's easy to hear why the song was so popular: As she sang about the plans that fall apart in the wake of a breakup and the sheer magnitude of her very first heartbreak, the rawness in Rodrigo's voice and lyrics spoke to those her own age and provided some potent flashbacks for those a little -- or a lot -- older than her. On the rest of her debut album Sour, she delivers on the potential of that blockbuster single and then some. Rodrigo nails what it's like to be 17, heartbroken, and frustrated, and updates the traditions of the sharp-eyed and sharp-tongued songwriters before her for Generation Z. Like her hero Taylor Swift, she's got a flair for details and a willingness to share every aspect of her heartache, even (or especially) the bitter side of it; on "Happier," she sings to her ex, "I hope you're happy/But don't be happier." Her ability to pair a sizeable amount of disdain with equally big hooks recalls Lorde on the slinky self-loathing of "Jealousy, Jealousy," and there are even shades of Alanis Morissette's jagged, jilted younger woman in "Deja Vu"'s hyper-literate litany of tarnished memories. Rodrigo expands on "Driver's License" with similarly barbed and self-aware power ballads like "Traitor," which captures the pain when an ex rebounds more quickly than expected, and with the folky introspection of "Favorite Crime," where she reflects on how her desperation to hang onto a relationship made her culpable in her own pain. However, Sour might be even more vital when Rodrigo lashes out on the album's rock-tinged songs. She revels in her anger on "Good 4 U"'s sneering verses and pogo-ing choruses, letting the drum rolls build up a head of steam that the riffs unleash, and begins the album with a surprisingly punky blast of angst on "Brutal," where she tears down the idealization of teenage years ("I'm so sick of seventeen/Where's my fuckin' teenage dream?") over guitars that are the musical equivalent of an eyeroll. Moments like these lend another exciting dimension to her music, even if she takes a few steps beyond the rest of the album's fury on the tender closing track "Hope Ur OK." Rodrigo wants to be taken seriously as a songwriter, and she should be -- her combination of sweet melodies and bitter moods, her conversational flow, and her self-awareness are all skills many songwriters twice her age would love to call their own, and they make Sour a well-rounded emotional journey and strong debut album.© Heather Phares /TiVo	17	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:57:25.916968	1
297109	GUTS	Olivia Rodrigo	150.39	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/tc/2z/vrqtmyvds2ztc_600.jpg	qobuz:227029550|vrqtmyvds2ztc	Much has been made of the fact that Olivia Rodrigo—unlike Phoebe Bridgers,Beabadoobee and Sabrina Carpenter—wasn't asked to join Taylor Swift on her Eras tour after failing to give Swift songwriting credit on two tracks from Sour, Rodrigo's 2021 debut. (The non-collaborative credits, largely for influence, were added later and to much hullabaloo.) But Rodrigo shouldn't be opening for anyone. She's a towering pop star with an appealingly awkward edge, admired by Annie Clark and Kathleen Hanna, who has called Rodrigo "a revelation." She lives up to that potential on her second album, a bottle rocket messily shooting off excitement and confusion and barbs, some of which land right back in her own heart. As a tween, Rodrigo starred in an American Girl movie. At 20, she's singing "all-american bitch," a clever roller coaster that goes from dreamy folk—her voice soft like breath on a dandelion puff—to giddy pop-punk. "With perfect all-American lips/ And perfect all-American hips/ I know my place, I know my place and this is it ... I scream inside to deal with it," she howls with sarcasm and angst. "bad idea right?" is an irresistible made-for-radio song, with head-banger guitar and new wave bounce, about hooking up with an ex against all better judgment ("See you tonight/ It's a bad idea right? Whatever, it's fine"). "Vampire" deliciously melds traces of Swift (bite your tongue) and My Chemical Romance as Rodrigo aims for the rafters and commits to the to the metaphor: "You sunk your teeth into me/ Bloodsucker, famefucker/ Bleedin' me dry, like a goddamn vampire." "Lacy" is a surprising bit of gothic folk that taps into complicated feelings of friendship and jealousy, its sweet guitar darkly contrasting with a sinister vocal effect. "ballad of a homeschooled girl" bounces on spring-loaded bass and careening '90s indie-rock guitar as she lays bare self-perceived social awkwardness: "I'm on the outside of the greatest inside joke/ And I hate all my clothes/ Feels like my skin doesn't fit right over my bones … Everything I do is tragic/ Every guy I like is gay." Rodrigo and producer Daniel Nigro have a keen sense of dynamics, varying the pop-punk and piano ballads that made Sour a smash. "Making the Bed" makes the most of a big swoony bridge, "Logical" lashes out at a "master manipulator" and "Teenage Dream" finds Rodrigo already worried about outgrowing her youthful charms: "And when does wide-eyed affection and all good intentions start to not be enough?" It's fucked-up and scary and sad, and it builds to a scream-along that is pure catharsis. "get him back!" is anthemic and unafraid to look a little crazy: "Wanna kiss his face (And then I want to get him back)/ With an uppercut (Then I want to get him back)/ I wanna meet his mom (And then I want to get him back)/ Just to tell her her son sucks (Then I want to get him back)." A former Disney girl, Rodrigo is never going to be able to hide her theater-kid tendencies, but there's plenty of room for the drama here. © Shelly Ridenour/Qobuz	24	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:57:25.916972	1

GUTS reveals that she didn't crumble under expectations -- instead, she took notes. Recorded with returning producer Daniel Nigro in the same garage studio where he and Rodrigo made Sour, the album hones in on her soaring, soul-baring ballads and spiky pop-punk manifestos and perfects them. "Driver's License" may have been her debut album's mega-hit, but many fans connected with fiercely catchy singles like "Good 4 U." Several of GUTS' standouts are in the same throbbing vein: Rodrigo cringes at herself and throws shade at an old flame on the new wave-y "love is embarrassing." She makes mistakes gleefully on "bad idea right?," a witty recollection of hooking up with an ex that rivals Wet Leg when it comes to chugging post-punk-pop with droll singalong choruses. Songs like these suggest that Rodrigo's record collection is growing along with her confidence, and though the way "all-american bitch" swings from deceptively winsome folk to raging punk shares pages with Phoebe Bridgers' and Courtney Love's songbooks, she ties it all together even more convincingly than she did on Sour. Likewise, GUTS' not-too-raw, not-too-slick production bolsters her talent for giving complex moods wide appeal. The song "get him back!" tangles revenge and longing in some of the album's most scathing lyrics ("I wanna meet his mom/Just to tell her her son sucks"), but it sounds like a direct hit. This gift is almost as uncommon as her ability to write lyrics so relatable that it feels like she's read her fans' diaries -- or minds. Rodrigo confronts the sting of second and third heartbreaks with hard-earned wisdom, and tracks like "making the bed" and "logical" add a refreshing dose of self-awareness to the catharsis of "Driver's License." And while "vampire"'s recriminations against older men who leech off of her and "sell (her) for parts" may not reflect the everyday reality of her listeners, it brings them into her world with as much authenticity as her other ballads. GUTS even features songs her listeners might not know they need yet: The breathy "pretty isn't pretty" tackles lookism and body dysmorphia, near-universal experiences for young women with surprisingly few songs written about them. Rodrigo does a remarkable job of balancing moments that are very much of the time when she made the album with moments that hint at more: "teenage dream" yearns for the day when she won't be wise beyond her years, and "lacy" explores the intricacies of jealousy and yearning with nuance that a singer/songwriter of any age would be proud to possess. GUTS is emphatic proof that Rodrigo isn't just good for a kid -- she's grown into an artist with plenty of things to say, and the confidence and eloquence to say them her way.© Heather Phares /TiVo	30	CD	2026-01-18 21:57:38.721107	2

500373	The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess	Chappell Roan	109.23	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/7b/6v/agcrn2c7b6v7b_600.jpg	qobuz:229054008|agcrn2c7b6v7b	It's easy to imagine that Chappell Roan emerged fully formed as a beehive-wearing queer icon, but Kayleigh Rose Amstutz was plucked from YouTube—via Missouri—at 17, then signed and dropped by a major label in the space of a year. She just needed the right moment: for people to grow weary of Taylor Swift's butter-wouldn't-melt earnestness. And Roan's clever, campy, exaggerated moment is now. How else could a delirious song like "HOT TO GO!" crack the Billboard Top 20? Shiny plastic New Wave with sex-positive lyrics ("And baby, don't you like this beat?/ I made it so you'd sleep with me!") and a monster cheer-squad chorus, it's a confetti cannon of a song. But the key to camp is self-awareness, and Roan knowingly revels in playful ridiculousness, making up words like "Femininomenon"—the hard-to-say title of a song that starts off as melodramatic as a Douglas Sirk movie before the shrieked line "Dude, can you play a song with a fucking beat?" (punchline: it gets shriekier with each delivery). Then a motorcycle revs, like a wink and jab at the misogyny of '80s hair metal, and Roan orders, "Get it hot like Papa John!" It's wild how all that artifice is ushering in an age of get-real acceptance. We've come a long way, baby, from the "provocation" of Katy Perry's "I Kissed a Girl"—which sounds wan more than 15 years later—to Roan singing "Knee deep in the passenger seat and you're eating me out/ Is it casual now?" on the lush power ballad "Casual," about a fuck buddy who won't commit. The album is produced by Dan Nigro, who helped Olivia Rodrigo brilliantly navigate from Disney star to vibrant hitmaker. He and Roan aren't afraid to layer on every accessory—"Guilty Pleasure" pummels with cartoon synth, the crispiest drum-machine beats and yodeling—or to let her inner theater kid turn up the drama to 11. Roan hits wineglass-shattering high notes on "My Kink is Karma," enjoying schadenfreude over an ex's misfortune. Winning "Red Wine Supernova" takes glee in call-and-response gang vocals ("Long hair (no bra!)/ That's my type (that's right!)"), and "Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl" roars like Madonna in her house era, leaning in over and over again to the build-and-drop as Roan blechs out at the chore of tolerating boring dudes: "This man wouldn't dance/ He didn't ask a single question/ And he was wearing these fugly jeans/ Ew!" There are a few Broadway-style ballads ("Coffee," "Kaleidoscope") and one truly unvarnished moment, "California," that seems to reference Roan's early failure before her rebound: "I miss the seasons in Missouri/ My dying town/ Thought I'd be cool in California … But I let you down." It's a sober bookend to "Pink Pony Club," her liberation anthem for kids who dream about escaping small-town, small-minded America for libertine West Hollywood. The best part? That's the song that got Roan dropped from her first record deal. Karma is her kink, after all. © Shelly Ridenour/Qobuz	18	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:57:41.177049	1

Playful, a little naughty, and full of heart, this debut brims with spirited pop gems that stick in the brain long after the album is finished. Blending the youthful Gen-Z delivery of Olivia Rodrigo, the best-friend-approachability of Taylor Swift, and the songcraft of Maggie Rogers, Roan is the main draw here, taking whatever producer Dan Nigro (Kylie, Rodrigo, Caroline Polachek) throws at her and making it irresistible. Opener "Femininomenon" perfectly captures the album's ethos: transforming from a sweet, string-laden ballad into a pulse-pounding empowerment anthem, it's punctuated with a mid-song pep talk and hilariously escalating adlibs demanding a "fucking beat." From there, it's a nonstop flood of catchy, synth-backed anthems that could lay waste to mainstream radio if given the chance. The playfully horny "Red Wine Supernova" rides a bubbly beat, Roan's pure vocals, and girl gang background vocals that boost energy, while the funky strut of the confident, boyfriend-stealing "After Midnight" turns the lights down low as she purrs that "everything good happens after midnight." Taking Taylor's Midnights hit one step further, Roan takes aim at an ex on the sardonic, synth-laden "My Kink Is Karma," where she finds pleasure in the little things like watching them "ruin [their] life... losing [their] mind... [and] crashing [their] car." There's a handful of delicate ballads ("Coffee," "Casual," "Picture You," "Kaleidoscope") peppered amongst the pogo-bounce singalongs ("HOT TO GO!" and early hit "Pink Pony Club") that offer a few moments of rest while the party continues. On an album packed with highlights, standouts include the '80s-synth throwback "Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl" -- a cowbell-laden, late night party saga that explodes with one of the most rousing choruses on Midwest Princess -- and the closer, "Guilty Pleasure," which mirrors the opening track's quiet-to-loud approach, morphing from warm dreampop into pulsing electro-pop. Bold and fearless, Chappell Roan's The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess is the best kind of pop album: capturing a generational zeitgeist and introducing the world to a refreshing new voice that can hopefully stand the test of time and a fickle industry.© Neil Z.

One of the intervening singles, "Hit Different," is vintage enough to be sampled -- slowed down to lend a spectral self-duet quality to "Love Language," among many songs on SOS that portrays romantic torment with conflicted emotions. SZA also draws "SOS" itself as a clip-emptying return, an opening scene soundtracked by muffled gospel soul, kicking down the door and staking claims with assaultive bars about her incontestible omnipotence and impostors hatched since she went supernova. Hour-plus length and stylistic variety likewise signal that SOS could be the overreaching kind of highly anticipated follow-up. Still, it's an advancement from Ctrl in every respect apart from cohesion, a feature purposefully disregarded by SZA and main songwriting/production collaborators Rob Bisel and Carter Lang. Take track two, "Kill Bill," a bleary/psychedelic pop-soul revenge fantasy with a performance of such nuance that escalating madness, delight, and shock can be sensed in SZA's confession to murder. "Gone Girl," yearning for comfort and intimate escape, is one of those sad stealth belters. The chaser is a cold-blooded if humor-laced rap broadside. Not far behind is a lonseome and spiteful country pop-punk rager and another number with some Nashville appeal, a codependent acoustic ballad. Fine as the classification-defying moments are, R&B soliloquies remain SZA's forte. The emotional and sonic complexity of SOS was teased by three such songs, pre-release singles placed toward the end that are crucial to the sequence. The brilliantly lean and scuffed Darkchild collaboration "Shirt" allows all the space needed for the singer to unleash some terse invective directed outward and inward. "I Hate U" is a striking depiction of intimate restlessness rendered as an inching slow jam that stings as much as it seduces. "Good Days" is both downcast and dazzling, covering exhaustion, regret, renewal, and progression in one spangled swoop. One of the latter ballad's finely wrought phrases, "a war in my mind," would have been just as suitable an album title as the distress signal.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	11	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:57:58.380893	1

492770	DON'T TAP THE GLASS	Tyler, The Creator	41.71	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/ob/9b/dkhmn3enn9bob_600.jpg	qobuz:347727778|dkhmn3enn9bob	The Tyler Okonma cottage industry has thrived for 15 years, from the Wu-Tang-like ascent of OFWGKTA (for nostalgia's sake, let's spell it out: Odd Future Wolf Gang Kill Them All) to his recent string of critical darlings, two of which (Igor and Call Me If You Get Lost) won the Best Rap Album Grammy. That's a career almost old enough to be sent to the boarding school where his cohort Earl Sweatshirt infamously spent time at 16, and nary a year of it has gone by without Tyler contributing something notable to rap culture. 2017's Flower Boy launched a vulnerable, R&B-influenced side of Tyler, the Creator that also reintroduced him as one of the genre's premier queer leading men after he initially used so many homophobic slurs for shock value that he was banned from entering the U.K. for a period. He's nowhere near ready to rest on his laurels, not with last year's ambitious Chromakopia, nor this surprise half-hour blast of electrodance unlike anything else in his restless catalog. The closest analogue is probably Vince Staples' great Big Fish Theory, a beats-first 2017 effort where Staples sounded off over two-step garage and got two very different legends (SOPHIE, Kendrick Lamar) on the same clanging, futuristic cut. Don't Tap the Glass is more consciously retro and consciously a party record, though, with Zapp-style vocoder on "Sucka Free" and blocky Zulu Nation electro on the soon-to-be club staple "Sugar on My Tongue." His early irreverence also returns almost instantly: "I like dark-skinned bitches like my mama," he declares on the opening "Big Poe," which features contributions from his idols, the Neptunes, and a prominent Busta Rhymes sample. This is easily Tyler's quickest, least indulgent record—just a lean, mean valentine to robotic synthesizers, with nine almost uniformly quick-tempoed jams and one pitched- and sped-down closer sung in a fake-Pharrell falsetto that sounds like Igor tightened up. Tightened and lightened up would be a plus for almost anyone's ninth album. © Daniel Aaron/Qobuz	19	CD	2026-01-18 21:58:44.775056	2

One of the intervening singles, "Hit Different," is vintage enough to be sampled -- slowed down to lend a spectral self-duet quality to "Love Language," among many songs on SOS that portray romantic torment with conflicted emotions. SZA also draws "SOS" itself as a clip-emptying return, an opening scene soundtracked by muffled gospel soul, kicking down the door and staking claims with assaultive bars about her incontestable omnipotence and impostors hatched since she went supernova. Hour-plus length and stylistic variety likewise signal that SOS could be the overreaching kind of highly anticipated follow-up. Still, it's an advancement from Ctrl in every respect apart from cohesion, a feature purposefully disregarded by SZA and main songwriting/production collaborators Rob Bisel and Carter Lang. Take track two, "Kill Bill," a bleary/psychedelic pop-soul revenge fantasy with a performance of such nuance that escalating madness, delight, and shock can be sensed in SZA's confession to murder. "Gone Girl," yearning for comfort and intimate escape, is one of those sad stealth belters. The chaser is a cold-blooded if humor-laced rap broadside. Not far behind is a lonesome and spiteful country pop-punk rager and another number with some Nashville appeal, a codependent acoustic ballad. Fine as the classification-defying moments are, R&B soliloquies remain SZA's forte. The emotional and sonic complexity of SOS was teased by three such songs, pre-release singles placed toward the end that are crucial to the sequence. The brilliantly lean and scuffed Darkchild collaboration "Shirt" allows all the space needed for the singer to unleash some terse invective directed outward and inward. "I Hate U" is a striking depiction of intimate restlessness rendered as an inching slow jam that stings as much as it seduces. "Good Days" is both downcast and dazzling, covering exhaustion, regret, renewal, and progression in one spangled swoop. One of the latter ballad's finely wrought phrases, "a war in my mind," would have been just as suitable an album title as the distress signal.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	25	CD	2026-01-18 21:58:10.260559	2

Previously, Rowe made quiet waves with the self-released, low bit-rate digital download S, as well as fantasy-like video for the track "Ice Moon," an alternately booming and fluttering track. For Z, she sticks to elusiveness with a soft focus over largely amorphous productions granted by the likes of Toro y Moi and Mac Miller, as well as Emile Haynie (Lana Del Rey, Bruno Mars), the last of whom handles three of the tracks within the second half. On "Sweet November," she uses Marvin Gaye's "Mandota." Its woozy drift snaps right into place with the rest of the material, as Rowe thinks up space cadet thoughts to match, opening with "Jesus called me collect last night." When Kendrick Lamar, Chance the Rapper, and Isaiah Rashad are added to the mix, Rowe seems even more like an instrument rather than a lead voice, but it's all comforting, if not revealing, made more for background or late-night listening than complete emotional immersion.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	18	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:58:10.26056	1

A tangled teen drama involving social anxiety, popularity, and a suicide note, its script was provided by the musical's book writer, Steven Levenson, who tweaks the ending, the importance of some of the characters, and omits four songs from the stage show ("Disappear," "To Break in a Glove," "Good for You," and "Anybody Have a Map"). Added to the song list is "The Anonymous Ones," sung by Amandla Stenberg (as Alana Beck), who co-wrote the song with original show composers Benj Pasek and Justin Paul. While the earnest tunes and weighty subject matter don't exactly get new life here, vocal performances are stellar by a cast that includes Platt and Broadway understudy Colton Ryan (as Connor Murphy) alongside Hansen newbies such as Stenberg and Julianne Moore, who gets her own song as Evan's mom, Heidi Hansen ("So Big/So Small"). With the exception of the irreverent "Sincerely Me," by Ryan, Platt, and Nik Dodani (Jared), the songs are so uniformly wistful, sincere, and pop-leaning that the five loyal, star-studded pop covers that close the 70-minute soundtrack don't do much to update the material. They include turns by Sam Smith, SZA, FINNEAS, an orchestral version of "Only Us" by Carrie Underwood and Dan + Shay, and an engaging, slightly airier "Waving Through a Window" by Tori Kelly.© Marcy Donelson /TiVo	30	CD	2026-01-18 21:58:10.260561	2

616809	Black Panther The Album Music From And Inspired By	Kendrick Lamar	361.95	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/kb/9g/crauirb2k9gkb_600.jpg	qobuz:54859394|crauirb2k9gkb	A culturally momentous film directed by a black man, featuring a black lead actor and a predominantly black supporting cast, Marvel Studios' Black Panther is augmented with an album powered by Kendrick Lamar. It's an unprecedented convergence of the mainstream film industry with an uncompromising musician thriving commercially and artistically. Director Ryan Coogler sought Lamar out to contribute to the album, but the artist ended up involved with every track, credited in varying combinations as headliner, featured artist, co-songwriter, and co-producer, with long-term producer Sounwave a factor in all but three cuts. Subtitled "Music from and Inspired By," this is not a soundtrack in the strictest sense. Indeed, a significant portion of the content -- from whole tracks like the Travis Scott turn "Big Shot," to the part where Future quotes Juicy J's "Slob on My Knob" -- has no relation to the film, though there's a reflectively militant quality to a high percentage of the verses. Elements that are alternately obvious and subtle, including tribal-futuristic drums, audio-logo-like mentions of character names, and ululations (the last instance via the Weeknd on the despairing but proud finale), are threaded throughout to maintain the connection. They frame Lamar, a central figure as he proclaims his sovereign rank and examines its pitfalls -- not a stretch for him. The set has a major crossover single bid in the form of "All the Stars," an elegantly crafted SZA showcase that sounds at once like a defiant hero's anthem and a love theme. Another canny aspect in the album's assemblage is its inclusion of several artists from South Africa. The most notable appearance is made by Yugen Blakrok, "half-machine" Johannesburg native who boasts of "crushing any system that belittles us," references Millie Jackson, and leaves a pile of smoldering rubble in her wake. Lamar also enlists England's Jorja Smith and James Blake, and a Stateside crew that includes Mozzy, Ab-Soul, and Anderson Paak, as well as SOB x RBE, who, like Coogler, represent the Bay Area. Given the level of the performances, the majority of the guests evidently approached this as a Kendrick Lamar album, not as a soundtrack. Black Panther: The Album serves both purposes well.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	32	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:58:10.260562	1

Right away, you know that Tatiana (her alter ego) is in control. Beyoncé has Sasha Fierce, Gaga had Jo Calderone, Nicki Minaj has countless onstage alter egos; McRae, who has described herself as a "pretty reserved Canadian," slips into this "feisty" and "obnoxious" (her words) character to leverage dance-floor sex appeal. And Tatiana comes with an A-list army: producer Ryan Tedder, guest stars including McRae's boyfriend Kid Laroi ("I Know Love"), and hit-making songwriters like Julia Michaels and Amy Allen (who have credits on Sabrina Carpenter's biggest hits as well as that aforementioned opener, the slinky slow roll "Miss possessive"). Their aim is true on So Close to What, but sometimes McRae's own firepower is a little lackluster. The best: "Sports car," a high-adrenaline fairground ride bumping with sirens, snaky rhythm and shake-rattle-roll bass. You can sense the cardio sweat dripping off McRae's whispered chorus—Ying Yang twins style—as she postures like early aughts Britney and Xtina. There's more of that nasty girl vibe on "It's ok I'm ok," complete with a rap breakdown and low-end like a door slamming over and over. Glycerine-smooth Tedder pulls out all the electropop stops: streaking whistle, echo effect and papercut-crisp drums on "2 hands"; a whirring siren and booming bass for dancefloor-ready "Dear God," which finds McRae asking for release from the spell a boomerang ex has over her ("Dear God, get his handprint out of my back/ Taking "amazing" out of our sex"). But the singer can sound bored when she applies a gauzy style on songs like "Signs" and "Revolving door," and she lets an amped-up Flo Milli steal the show on "bloodonmyhands." Co-written with Emile Haynie (Bruno Mars, Camila Cabello) and mixed by the excellent Manny Marroquin (Kendrick Lamar, Post Malone), R&B baby maker "Purple lace bra" is made to play loud; McRae starts off with a knock-out punch—"I was singing! I was screaming!"—before floating off into a sleepy chorus. But that soft touch makes sense on "Nostalgia," the album's stripped-down, acoustic-guitar closer.  © Shelly Ridenour/Qobuz	27	CD	2026-01-18 21:58:13.231728	2

Like similar leaps from Britney, Christina, and Dua, everything is intensified here, from the beats and energy to the choruses and the emotions. Finally taking some first steps beyond early comparisons to Billie Eilish and Olivia Rodrigo, both in style and delivery ("Want That Too" is one of a handful of moments where similarities persist), Think Later feels like her grand-premiere statement, the marquee breakthrough meant to plant McRae's flag on Planet Pop. Staking her claim with cinematic atmospherics ("Run for the Hills"), beat-forward production ("Cut My Hair"), irresistible pop hooks ("Exes"), and journal-worthy lyrics for fans of her earlier work ("Messier"), the set is all-killer-no-filler from the opening run that includes the international smash hit "Greedy" -- an addictive earworm that rides popping Timbaland-esque production to a sweaty, breathless conclusion -- to the moving comedown of "Plastic Palm Trees." For every mega-moment, like "Think Later," which recalls the bass-heavy boom and singalong thrill of M.I.A.'s "Bad Girls," she drops something absolutely pained like "Calgary," a torn ode to her hometown that swirls confusion and hope into a relatable mix, or "We're Not Alike," a tale of betrayal that cuts as deep as a stab to the back. McRae excels at balancing these two sides of the spectrum, injecting attitude and swagger into the radio-friendly pop gems while keeping listeners on the verge of tears with her tender moments of vulnerability. That kind of double threat elevates Think Later, revealing McRae as a potent voice and keen ear that can deliver emotion and excitement in equal measure.© Neil Z.

With a team of producers that includes Ryan Tedder and ILYA, McRae masters this sweaty collection of dance-friendly, club-ready anthems that channels the early-2000s energy of Britney Spears, Pussycat Dolls, and Ciara. The best of that bunch -- "Miss Possessive," "Sports Car," "2 Hands," "Revolving Door," and "No I'm Not in Love" -- elevate the album with radio-ready hits that keep the pulse pounding, while the sublime production on songs such as "Purple Lace Bra" and "Better Than I Was" merges the hazy, dream-like R&B sonics of late-2010s Ariana Grande and Banks. There's also a batch of pensive, vulnerable moments -- including "Greenlight" and "Nostalgia" -- that offers a bittersweet view into the "real" McRae who exists behind the pop star glitz and industry spotlight. Overall, the improved production value and lyrical direction point at an intentional maturation for McRae -- like Britney, Ariana, and so many others before her -- who seizes the post-breakthrough moment with this major sonic statement. McRae delivers on the promise of Think Later, levelling up with this set of addictive pop gems and heartfelt confessionals.© Neil Z. Yeung /TiVo	17	CD	2026-01-18 21:58:26.029357	2

Overall, the improved production value and lyrical direction point at an intentional maturation for McRae -- like Britney, Ariana, and so many others before her -- who seizes the post-breakthrough moment with this major sonic statement. McRae delivers on the promise of Think Later, levelling up with this set of addictive pop gems and heartfelt confessionals.© Neil Z. Yeung /TiVo	13	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:58:26.02936	1

785058	Pure Heroine	Lorde	135.76	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/ob/jt/d8r0ercj0jtob_600.jpg	qobuz:128186956|d8r0ercj0jtob	Signed to a major label at an early age, she was groomed in the darkness of studios, the label knowing the potential they had in their singer/songwriter. She wrote on her own, then she was paired with a sympathetic producer/songwriter, live performances taking a back seat to woodshedding. If this story in the early years of the 2010s brings to mind Lana Del Rey, it's no coincidence that it also applies to New Zealand singer/songwriter Lorde, whose 2013 debut, Pure Heroine, contains all of the stylized goth foreboding of LDR's Born to Die and almost none of the louche, languid glamour. This is not a small thing. Lana Del Rey is a self-created starlet willing herself into stardom but Lorde fancies herself a poet, churning away at the darker recesses of her soul. Some of this may be due to age. Lorde, as any pre-release review or portrait helpfully illustrated, was only 16 when she wrote and recorded Pure Heroine with producer Joel Little, and an adolescent aggrievance and angst certainly underpin the songs here. Lorde favors a tragic romanticism, an all-or-nothing melodrama that Little accentuates with his alternately moody and insistent productions. Where Lana Del Rey favors a studiously detached irony, Lorde pours it all out which, in itself, may be an act: her bedsit poetry is superficially more authentic but the music is certainly more pop, both in its construction -- there are big hooks in the choruses and verses -- and in the production, which accentuates a sad shimmer where everything is beautiful and broken. There is a topical appeal here, particularly because Lorde and Little do spend so much time on the surface, turning it into something seductive, but it is no more real than the studied detachment of Lana Del Rey, who Lorde so strongly (and intentionally) resembles. Born to Die is meant to be appreciated as slippery, elusive pop; Pure Heroine seems to hint at the truth...but the truth is, Lorde is a pop invention as much as LDR and is not nearly as honest about her intentions.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	10	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:58:28.590211	1
633507	Virgin	Lorde	84.25	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/yc/71/b3fogo6m771yc_600.jpg	qobuz:343367690|b3fogo6m771yc	On her fourth album, Lorde is pushing the envelope and taking more chances than just about anyone in her class. Those experiments don't always live up to her ambitions, but it's an interesting ride. Ditching the trendy touch of Jack Antonoff, who produced her last two albums and whose imprint is distinctly his own, she co-produced the record herself with Jim E-Stack (Caroline Polachek, Gracie Abrams). It's a symbolic shedding of the past that suits her seemingly restless but assured mood. In the most obvious ways, Virgin is a breakup record, but it doesn't feel sad so much as ready to reinvent on moody, emotive "Shapeshifter" and "Broken Glass," with its synth as bouncy as a trampoline; both of those songs evoke Robyn, and it suits Lorde well. "What Was That"—a chic electro-pop track with syncopated synth and a metallic quality to the vocal effects—finds her looking back but not mournful: "MDMA in the back garden, blow our pupils up/ We kissed for hours straight, well, baby, what was that?/ I remember saying then/ This is the best cigarette of my life." It's a song with so much anticipatory promise that never quite builds to a cohesive point. Ditto "Hammer," with its big, wild shaking rhythm that threatens a good time but doesn't really make it there. Soulful "Man of the Year" does, though. It starts off minimalist but not spare, with Lorde singing over warm bass from Dev Hynes, then a noisy buzz gives way to sharp drums; it's a momentary thrill that dissipates before you get too attached. Lorde has said the record is, in part, about figuring out her gender identity, which she has most recently classified as being "in the middle" (she still refers to herself as cis woman and uses she/her pronouns). That knowledge gives intriguing weight to lines like "You met me at a really strange time in my life/ Take my knife and I cut the cord/ My babe can't believe I've become someone else/ Someone more like myself," from "Man of the Year." (The album also seems to be a love letter to New York City, name-checking Prince Street, Canal Street and the Williamsburg venue Baby's All Right.) Good-weird "Favourite Daughter" travels to a jump-rope beat, throbbing  "Current Affairs" is punctuated by ghostly moans and chords that strike out like laser beams, and "GRWM" is lush and soulful. Synth-heavy "If She Could See Me Now" samples Baby Bash and Frankie J's "Suga Suga." Most affecting are "Clearblue," as in the pregnancy test, with the unaccompanied, unnerving vocals stabbing over and over; and closer "David," which finds Lorde duetting with herself. © Shelly Ridenour/Qobuz	29	CD	2026-01-18 21:58:41.699369	2
502163	AT.LONG.LAST.A$AP	A$AP Rocky	72.89	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/05/66/0886445246605_600.jpg	qobuz:24769271|0886445246605	Graduating from good weed to good-trippin' LSD, rapper A$AP Rocky tunes in, drops out, and turns down for what on At. Long. Last. A$AP, a positive and psychedelic LP that is -- due to the death of A$AP Yams -- touched with the hippie version of wistful. Yams shares the executive producer credit with Danger Mouse, and there's plenty of evidence most of the album was finished before Yams passed, but the A$AP Mob's creative leader's death certainly bookends this effort, beginning with the sorrowful and sober opener, "Holy Ghost," an O Brother, Where Art Thou tribute that's just as wry, epic, and grave. On the closing highlight "Back Home" with guest Mos Def, Yams is sampled, giving an ambitious pep talk to the Mob before a railcar sound effect ushers him into the hereafter, and yet, the center of the album is entirely Rocky's own journey, one the returning listener can link to with murky stompers such as the Juicy J and UGK feature "Wavybone." Solo cut "Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye 2 (LPFJ2)" might be brother A$AP Ferg's hit single "Work" run backwards, but the rest of the album pushes the Mob sound into new territories, including the uptown and funky "Everyday," a Rod Stewart and Miguel feature that feels more like a Mark Ronson cut than Rocky's. It doesn't sound out of place, as this is the ambitious effort that offers Rocky's own "Strawberry Fields" in "L$D," an elaborate and glorious number where a woman's love and grace are a metaphor for psychedelics. Both are life-changing in the rapper's eyes, and as such, strip clubs now need more challenging anthems like "Electric Body," a bent and bent-over number featuring ScHoolboy Q. Lil Wayne is here for the swaggering "M'$" ("But my neck is gold, the rest is froze/Sex and hoes, best of both"), which comes off like a 45 got knocked out of its spindle and the earth's core is now a subwoofer, while the Kanye West bragger "Jukebox Joints" ("Man everything basic to Ye Guevara/That means Saint Laurent is my Zara") is both soulful enough to be on the Stones Throw label and strange enough to be on the Yeezus album. Too many tracks, too many guests, and too many ideas are all complaints that could be entertained, but like the drug LSD doesn't care that work starts at 9 a.m. tomorrow, the all-encompassing A.L.L.A. can't be bothered with life's tight schedule. The bold effort unfolds as it wants and deserves, so think of the album as A$AP in Wonderland, or the cloud rap genre revived and improved, or a sunshine kaleidoscope album à la Prince's Around the World in a Day that also comes with a touching and bittersweet tribute.© David Jeffries /TiVo	22	CD	2026-01-18 21:58:59.721164	2
382527	TESTING	A$AP Rocky	258.52	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/1b/47/owju8hfw4471b_600.jpg	qobuz:49983652|owju8hfw4471b	While his endless charisma and effortlessly confident delivery were the hallmarks of Harlem rapper A$AP Rocky's chart-topping songs, there were hints of budding experimentation even in his earliest tracks. Songs defined by murky, narcotic production choices showed up alongside the most by-the-numbers club bangers on 2013 debut LONG.LIVE.A$AP and its reflective 2015 follow-up, AT.LONG.LAST.A$AP, had moments that bordered on dream pop. Third album Testing pushes A$AP's experimental impulses to the forefront, expanding his boundary-pushing tendencies into the album's mission statement. There's an immediate feeling of creative abandon in the swell of subsonic bass that opens the record and leads into the messy, swimming "Distorted Records." Fragmented vocal samples, quick left-turns mid-song, and barely contained tape echo show up over and over again. This can be as subtle as the dub-like delays on lead single "A$AP Forever" or as extreme as the Kodak Black-assisted "CALLDROPS." Built on a looping sample of obscure acid folk artist Dave Bixby, the mellow, beatless meditation is more a distant sound collage than anything you'd hear on a mainstream rap record. "Gunz N Butter," featuring Juicy J, meets somewhere in the middle of unfettered experimentation and predictable hip-hop production, with A$AP delivering metered verses between disjointed vocal samples and randomly placed gunshot sound effects. Testing often feels like an uneasy dream, and this feeling is added to by the sometimes awkward sway toward more personal lyrical content. On "OG Beeper," nostalgic remembrances of troubled younger days are buried beneath an anxious beat, and the warped and woozy "Kids Turned Out Fine" inverts this perspective, looking at the troubles of the next generation. "Changes" melts in and out of cloudy, overblown musical segments and clearly spoken sections inspecting rejection, insecurity, and depression with a startling level of vulnerability. While in some ways Testing is more musical than anything we've heard from A$AP Rocky before, it's also more confused, with ideas and musical shifts colliding at times to the point of randomness. The album title itself refers to testing new sounds and pushing in new directions in hopes of growth. Like any set of experiments, Testing offers some success, some failure, and some moments that can only be met with a blank stare. Though songs like the gorgeous Frank Ocean collaboration "Purity," or the darkly simmering "Fukk Sleep" featuring FKA Twigs, take risks that push A$AP Rocky to new, exciting territory, some of the experiments that made it onto Testing could have been left bubbling over in the lab rather than weighing down the rest of the album.© Fred Thomas /TiVo	7	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:59:12.32216	1
961742	ARTPOP	Lady Gaga	228.7	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/8a/u4/jbmeguxwpu48a_600.jpg	qobuz:69300589|jbmeguxwpu48a	If Born This Way was made for the Little Monsters, its 2013 sequel ARTPOP was made for the world. Lady Gaga has grand designs for her third album, to pull a "reverse Warhol," which presumably means she wants to channel high art into pop instead of pop into high art, but it's a little difficult to discern Gaga's intent, either in this statement or ARTPOP as a whole. Willfully existing simply on the surface, a surface that perhaps (or perhaps not) signifies a greater depth, ARTPOP is teasingly garish, its bright colors and brittle beats attacking with glee, the emphasis always on big, pulsating beats, shattered reflections, sound cascading over song in every instance. Inevitably, this emphasis on production means the pop in ARTPOP winds up diminished; perhaps it's "pop" in the pop-art sense, as it's shamelessly, intentionally populist, but as pop music it relies not on hooks in either its melody or rhythm, but rather a full-on glitz blitz that can dazzle as often as it tires. Lost in her self-generated mythos, Gaga doesn't much care whether her music sticks as long as she's not ignored -- even such seemingly soul-baring moments as the single-spotlight showcase "Dope" isn't confessional so much as a gearshift designed to capture attention -- and ARTPOP continually demands attention as it eschews the notion of love, right down to how all the sex songs deliberately separate the body from the soul. This isn't limited to Gaga's exhortation to R. Kelly to "do what you want with my body" on "Do What U Want," either. At times -- particularly throughout the album's first half -- ARTPOP is a non-stop erotic cabaret, Gaga contorting herself to fulfill any desire, switching roles between a guy and a girl and a bottom and a top, her ambidexterous sexuality signaling power, not sensuality. This same arrogance glides her through songs about style -- the ludicrous "Donatella," a tribute to Versace that borders on character assassination; "Fashion!," which isn't a David Bowie cover, no matter how much it longs to be -- and songs about drugs, a cycle that takes her toward a concluding coda where Gaga stands resplendent in the applause.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	11	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:50:52.974404	1

Leaving the sullen introspection of her teens behind, Lorde now basks in the sun, soaking up the rays and exuding good vibes. This doesn't mean Solar Power is an album riddled with uptempo bops and hooks, however. Lorde keeps things subdued and stoned, stretching out her tunes and burying her vocals underneath approximations of folk and chill-out pop. Every so often, songs threaten to emerge from the haze -- a lyric catches hold, melodies start to gain shape -- then they drift back into the mist where they swirl until they dissipate. Such formlessness feels deliberate; it's as if Lorde is consciously avoiding the path that would lead to a satisfying conclusion because she's more interested in the journey than the destination. Wandering can generate its own rewards provided you're in the mood to get lost. That sentiment applies to Solar Power. If you're riding and vibing with Lorde, this bright shapelessness is superb mood music. If you're not riding her wave, Solar Power can seem elusive, even cloying, as it circles and sways with a smile.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	10	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:58:41.699373	1

The EP, which includes her signature hit, finds the Kiwi chanteuse offering up five evocative, electro-pop meditations on life, love, and the eternal joys and pains of youth, providing a sultry, sinewy soundtrack to summer that will likely draw comparisons to artists like Sky Ferreira, Florence + the Machine, Lana Del Ray, and Grimes.© Rovi Staff /TiVo	8	CD	2026-01-18 21:58:41.699374	2
923111	Solar Power	Lorde	194.59	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/ua/fk/qwssrqq2afkua_600.jpg	qobuz:136760238|qwssrqq2afkua	At 16, Lorde's debut album was all gimlet-eyed precociousness with a side of cynicism; four years later, she delved into, well, melodrama for Melodrama. Now, at 24, she's lightened up and turned her focus to "mystical ambitions" and "inner visions." (And when Lorde, neé Ella Yelich-O'Connor, focuses, she really commits to the theme.) Solar Power is the sound of a questioning young woman wanting to find solace in a trendy brand of spirituality but not always able to shake off the sensation that it might all be a scam. "Mood Ring" adopts an easy-breezy Natasha Bedingfield vibe and sly little New Age guitar flourishes to send up the Instagram wellness culture Lorde readily admits to dabbling in. "Ladies, begin your sun salutations/ transcendental in your meditations," she sings. "I can't feel a thing/ I keep looking at my mood ring." The beachy, Caribbean-kissed "Dominoes" casts a devastatingly casual side-eye at an ex who's gone "all New Age" and is "doing yoga with Uma Thurman's mother just outside of Woodstock": "It's strange to see you smoking marijuana/ You used to do the most cocaine of anyone I'd ever met." Elsewhere, she sounds Joni Mitchell wistful and gets deep, musing how "all the beautiful girls, they will fade like roses" before checking herself: "Maybe I'm just stoned at the nail salon again." The title track finds true solace, though, in the healing power of the sun—not the "golden hour" of aspirational influencers, but high-in-the-sky, blinding, noontime brightness. "Lead the boys and girls onto the beaches/ Come one, come all, I'll tell you my secrets/ I'm kinda like a prettier Jesus," she sings, supported by peers Phoebe Bridgers and Claire "Clairo" Cottrill and carried by a lush Verve-style melody. "Secrets from a Girl (Who's Seen It All)" folks-out like cottage-core Taylor Swift, but to the point that it makes you wonder how much Taylor owes Lorde. The latter cleverly calls on Swedish pop star Robyn to inject a weird and humorous, psych-hazy spoken part—"Thank you for flying with Strange Airlines, I will be your tour guide today/ Your emotional baggage can be picked up at carousel number two." Also like Taylor, Lorde is good at offering fans just enough teases of intimacy: a reference to Carole King presenting her a Grammy (in the twinkling "California"); an ode to her two-decades-older boyfriend (who has an "office job" and "silver hair" and whose "favorite record [is] the same as my father's") in the tender and free-floating "The Man with the Axe." Even without those Easter eggs, Solar Power is a revealing portrait of a girl trying to figure it all out—all while seeming aware of just how much privilege she has. © Shelly Ridenour/Qobuz	10	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:58:41.699374	1
335898	Melodrama	Lorde	336.18	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/08/25/0060255772508_600.jpg	qobuz:41420767|0060255772508	Growing up in public has been a rite of passage for pop stars since at least Frank Sinatra but, as with any classic storyline, what matters is the execution. Lorde, the preternaturally talented New Zealand singer/songwriter who became an international sensation at the age of 17, knows how to execute not only songwriting and public narrative but also a melding of the two. Melodrama, arriving nearly four long years after her 2013 debut, picks up the thread left hanging on Pure Heroine, presenting Lorde as a young woman, not a sullen teenager. Tonally and thematically, it's a considerable shift from Pure Heroine, and Melodrama feels different musically too, thanks in part to Lorde's decision to collaborate with Jack Antonoff, the leader of Fun. and Bleachers who has been nearly omnipresent in 2010s pop/rock. Antonoff's steely signatures -- a reliance on retro synths, a sheen so glassy it glares -- are all over the place on Melodrama but Lorde is unquestionably the auteur of the album, not just because the songs tease at autobiography but because of how it builds upon Pure Heroine. Lorde retains her bookish brooding, but Melodrama isn't monochromatic. "Green Light" opens the proceedings with a genuine sense of exuberance and it's an emotion she returns to often, sometimes reveling in its joy, sometimes adding an undercurrent of melancholy. Sadness bubbles to the surface on occasion, as it does on the stark "Liability," and so does Lorde's penchant for blunt literalism -- "Writer in the Dark," where our narrator sings "bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark," thereby suggesting all of her songs are some kind of autobiography -- but these traits don't occupy the heart of the album. Instead, Lorde is embracing all the possibilities the world has to offer but then retreating to the confines of home, so she can process everything she's experienced. This balance between discovery and reflection gives Melodrama a tension, but the addition of genuine, giddy pleasure -- evident on the neon pulse of "Homemade Dynamite" and "Supercut" -- isn't merely a progression for Lorde, it's what gives the album multiple dimensions.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	8	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:58:41.699374	1

Yet, this growth also comes with uncertainty: past mistakes becoming echoes that stir more regret with each reverberation, the accumulation of experiences fueling a pervasive sense of anxious unpredictability, the self-consciousness that, for a public figure, is often accompanied by a fear of the loss of that actual self. Chromakopia shows Tyler diving deep into these subjects to examine his problems with a sense of empathetic catharsis, where his struggles lead him to ruminate on other peoples' struggles, too. Sometimes they're familial: recordings of his mother position her as an alternately motivating, morally instructive, and apologetic presence throughout, culminating in their devastating late-album reckoning with Tyler's resemblance to his absent father on "Like Him." Sometimes they're romantic, like the cosmic Bill Withers vibe of "Judge Judy," which shifts unexpectedly from a kink-positive reminiscence of a youthful fling to a tragic but reverent memorial for his partner. And sometimes, like on "Take Your Mask Off," it's omnidirectional—a confrontation with false lives that encompass middle-class gangbanger wannabes, self-loathing gay preachers, dream-deferring tradwives, and ultimately his own superstar-ambitious self. Chromakopia runs through a conceptual framework where Tyler as "St. Chroma" attempts to maintain a false facade that can't fully conceal a neurosis that's more concerning and more honest than the front he puts on. He repeatedly boasts of owning a LaFerrari that he eventually admits in "Tomorrow" isn't much of a substitute for a family of his own, and offers an altruistic perspective on his polyamory ("Darling, I") that runs directly into the stark reality of what happened when he caused an unplanned pregnancy ("Hey Jane," which is vivid from the perspective of both partners). The way Chromakopia works through these contradictions and wrestles with his identity is borne out in a next-level musicality. Tyler's incredible versatility as a rapper with melodic range is emotive whether he's whispering, growling, keening in falsetto or belting out get-hype emphasis. That carries through to his production, too, which evokes everything from Neptunian synth-funk (the "Drop It Like It's Hot"-evoking "Darling, I") to Alchemical stoner metal (the Zamrock-goes-Sabbath "Noid") to linebacker-impact future-crunk ("Sticky," which strips Polow da Don-style drumline maximalism to a T-1000 skeleton). He's not alone in this unstable place—choice guest verses by Doechii ("Balloon"), ScHoolboy Q ("Thought I Was Dead"), and a GloRilla/Sexyy Red/Lil Wayne confab ("Sticky") bolster his more confident moments—but Tyler has mastered the ability to make his own self feel like he's carrying a whole squad's worth of insights. © Nate Patrin/Qobuz	26	CD	2026-01-18 21:58:44.775051	2

He was once one of the rising stars of the underground rap scene only to be wiped out by a series of setbacks. Tyler came back with a bang, demonstrating his passion for beautiful orchestration on the excellent Flower Boy released in the summer of 2017. The Flowerboy revealed a diversified pallet of charged soul and R&B that was conscientious and terribly sensitive, already beginning to move away from the constraints of rap. Tyler favored detail over bursts of witty remarks like on Cherry Bomb. It was a divergent move that the Angelino had already taken with the erratic Goblin. While it follows Flower Boy musically in terms of melody (EARFQUAKE, A BOY IS A GUN), IGOR is unique and proves that if Tyler had stumbled upon obstacles in the past, it’s because his genius was badly contained rather than managed.While Flower Boy maintained the beautiful vestiges of the Goblin era, IGOR is a more radical departure. Do not be fooled, IGOR is not a rap album. No, IGOR blurs the lines between rap, electro, soul and R&B with a fantastic layering of synthesizers and tasteful samples (Head West, Bibi Mascel, Run DMC, Ponderosa Twins Plus One…). There is still significant influence from Pharrell Williams (I THINK) who can be found on the production of ARE WE STILL FRIENDS?. When it comes to lyrics, Tyler discusses a range of lost lovers further raising the question of his sexual ambiguity. IGOR features many of Tyler usual collaborators: Kali Uchis, King Krule, Frank Ocean, A$AP Rocky and Playboi Carti. An absolute classic. © Charlotte Saintoin/Qobuz	21	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:58:57.201559	1

114272	CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST	Tyler, The Creator	93.27	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/lb/19/qriw7fu7e19lb_600.jpg	qobuz:124521674|qriw7fu7e19lb	Not two seconds into his sixth LP, CALL ME IF YOU GET LOST, Tyler, the Creator boldly stakes his claim with rap: ""Y'all ready?" booms the voice of DJ Drama, before the iconic "GANGSTA GRIZZILZ" tag jolts the album to life. Hosted by the legendary master-of-ceremonies, Tyler's latest LP imprints all the lessons of the last 8 years onto the raw rap talent of the Wolf era, combining visceral verses with expansive layers of production. Working with the likes of Westside Gunn and Freddie Gibbs has revitalised the outright fun of T's verses -- "AARGH, YOU LOOK MALNOURISHED" - as well as bringing the vivid storytelling of the former contrarian into subjects of vast personal import. It proves a sharp left turn after the progressive pop of 2019's IGOR -- but one that is realised with an unrelenting passion.Tyler's work has always been a patchwork of ever-increasing palettes, and CMIYGL is his most complex to date. Recurring tricks are masterfully melded into new templates: "RUNITUP!" continues the build-and-burst of "See You Again," "RISE!" folds IGOR's layered vocal textures into new visions, and "LEMONHEAD" channels Cherry Bomb for what sounds like an unironic take on Pink Guy's "Club Banger 3000." Yet it's equally clear that Tyler is continuing to expand with the sounds of his collaborators -- an intergalactic warble colours Uzi’s “JUGGERNAUT” tour-de-force, while yacht-rap lessons from The Alchemist make for a spectacle on “HOT WIND BLOWS” and “SIR BAUDELAIRE.” These new strides find a potent home among Tyler’s powerful-yet-familiar production toolkit; “I been switchin' gears since Tracee Ellis Ross was UPN” he raps on digital-only closer “SAFARI,” its soundscape playing out like a collage of each of his technicolour eras.As with every Tyler record, there’s a plethora of breadcrumbs to follow. The album’s central thread proffers a compelling forbidden-desire narrative, while the scratchy vocals akin to a much-referenced Wolf Haley are enough to make anyone drag their donut-print back out the wardrobe. In the minutiae, CMIYGL is equally abundant: "SWEET" is the full version of the interlude at the end of 2017's "I Ain't Got Time," while the Gravediggaz sample on "LUMBERJACK" is a sly wink to a tweet from the Bastard era. That’s saying nothing of the cryptic “Tyler Baudelaire”; fans of Charles Baudelaire may find the poet’s resonance in “WILSHIRE” and the album’s stretching, international escapism, though concrete answers remain shrouded.In a 2011 conversation with Nas, Tyler played every part the fan: "Nazareth Savage," the rapper exclaims, recalling his favourite sample from the Brooklyn legend, "that s*** is, like, legit as f***." Ten years on, Tyler finds himself recreating the beat for his own dizzying "MANIFESTO." It proves not only an acknowledgement of his icon, but an apt parallel for CMIYGL's daring return to rap: not only does Tyler possess every ounce of the talent to square up with rap's greats, he now has confidence enough to do so.© David Crone /TiVo	12	CD	2026-01-18 21:58:57.201562	2

With Tyler, The Creator's debut album, the rap world finally started to take his Odd Future crew seriously. That meant no more condescension, no more questions about the identity or credibility of members Frank Ocean, Earl Sweatshirt or Hodgy Beats. In 2011, the leader of the troupe demonstrated his ample talents with Goblin. He produced almost all of the album's fifteen tracks, and alternates between long introspective pieces such as Window or Goblin, and sure-fire hits like the single Yonkers, or electronic instrumentals like AU79. This versatility won him critical recognition and respect. Audiences felt like they were witnessing the rebirth of an artist who had a bright future ahead of him. Tyler was skilfully building up a sharp, visual body of work, and leaving behind the adolescent image of the old Odd Future days. With Goblin, the group entered adulthood without losing any of their hardness (Sandwiches) or their sensuality (She, featuring Frank Ocean).

While contemporaries reckon against trap fatigue or labor for social media relevancy, the maverick rapper-producer exists on an island of his own, sailing over the horizon like an indifferent mystic every 2 years to deliver another singular LP. But where the recent IGOR and CMIYGL served up vibrant, neatly structured narratives, his seventh studio album, Chromakopia, proves a little harder to decipher -- this is Tyler at his most earnest, but also his most uneven. "Give a f*** about traditions, stop impressing the dead" runs searching opener "St. Chroma," and at first glance the album seems intent on breaking them: it's his first since 2011's Goblin without a divided track ten, the first to not feature his signature "ayo," and most importantly, the first to break his two-year release pattern since his 2009 debut, Bastard. "St. Chroma," Tyler's strongest intro to date, is an immediate collage of intent, flip-flopping from scratchy militarism to soaring gospel before making way for the equally explosive "Rah Tah Tah" and "NOID." But while this militia-like opening trio create a brilliant, unified new sound, the rest of the album drops it abruptly: "Darling I," "Take Your Mask Off," and "Judge Judy" sound a little like Flower Boy pastiches (the latter proving a particular lowlight with its grating "juuuuuuudge" chorus), while "Balloon" pierces the album's pensive closers with a misplaced, funfair-like irreverence. Tyler has produced his best material while building all-encompassing worlds for his ideas -- the drifting summerscapes of Flower Boy, the chromatic heartbreak of IGOR -- in contrast, Chromakopia can feel both impulsive and reiterative. Yet while Chromakopia's soundscapes do little to break the mold, his words tell a different story. The central St Chroma character appears to represent a masking of the truest self; Tyler spends much of the album unpacking his heritage, sexual preferences, and most surprisingly, potential fatherhood. Some of the moments here are among the most candid of his career: "Hey Jane" is a raw, sometimes ugly back-and-forth between Tyler and his potential child's mother, "Noid" lashes wildly at parasocial relationships and fame-driven paranoia, and "Like Him" sees Tyler "chasing a ghost" at the recognition of his father's features. The 33-year-old rapper's fear of ageing comes to a culmination on the beautifully nocturnal "Tomorrow"; hypnotically unfurling his regrets, Tyler shadows Kanye's iconic "Welcome to Heartbreak" with a conflicted "my brodie had another baby, that's like number two… and all I got is photos of my 'Rari and some silly suits." Chromakopia is less of a cohesive statement than Tyler's fans are used to hearing; it's erratic and candid at once, a strange pressure cooker of boasts and doubts that falls out of step with its deftly sequenced and thematically tight predecessors. But these are the sounds at the precipice of change -- perhaps it's fitting that Tyler can't quite package himself as neatly this time around.© David Crone /TiVo	9	CD	2026-01-18 21:58:57.201564	2

First came his single Peso, then his first mixtape, LIVE. LOVE. ASAP. As a member of the New York collective A$AP Mob, he went from hopeful to heavyweight in no time, influenced by the sounds of the Big Apple, but above all by Southern rap, especially the Houston sound. The slowed down tempos on Acid Drip, the distorted voices on Bass, the nebulous ambiences on Wassup... His sound palette, fleshed out by producers like Clams Casino, DJ Burn One again or Beautiful Lou, is strikingly broad. The guests are prestigious: Schoolboy-Q reaches new heights on Brand New Guy, Fat Tony represents Houston with Get Lit, and colleagues A$AP Ferg, A$AP Twelvy and A$AP Nast make LIVE. LOVE. ASAP feel like a family affair. The sound is sophisticated, rather muted on Demons and massive on Peso. This was surely the most resounding mixtape of the 2010s, and the one that won A$AP Rocky his place in the annals of American rap. - © Brice Miclet/Qobuz	23	CD	2026-01-18 21:59:12.322164	2

431099	Views	Drake	76.8	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/53/43/0060254794353_600.jpg	qobuz:31964047|0060254794353	Since the release of his last non-mixtape/non-collaboration album in 2013, Drake has solidified his position as a pop music icon, scaling the charts, dominating gossip columns, and generally living the good life. Or so it seems. 2016's Views is another in a string of dour transmissions from the dark night of Drake's soul. As before, he casts himself as both the melancholy bachelor looking out over the city from his penthouse manor, and the criminally underrated rap genius demanding his due, and it's one album too many for both personas. He's already delved deeply into his insecurities, lambasted all his exes, and displayed his fierce self-pride, never shying away from telling everyone exactly where he started and how far he's come. Frankly, it's become as boring and annoying as a needle stuck in a groove. No matter how ably the production casts his raps and ballads in the best possible light, no matter how well the frequent use of chopped and swirled samples from '90s R&B songs fit in the mix, no matter that the occasional song rises up from the narrative and makes a splash, the album is a meandering, dreary rehash of what Drake has done before in much better fashion. Of the songs that stand out, his uptempo, Caribbean-flavored duet with Rihanna ("Too Good") is the most enjoyable; "One Dance," another song with a Jamaican dancehall feel, is another fun track. Still, these poppy moments feature Drake as the wounded lover, being treated poorly yet again. A few other tracks connect, like the almost light-hearted "Feel No Ways," which makes good use of a stuttering Malcolm McLaren sample or, of course, the hugely catchy hit song "Hotline Bling." The nostalgic "Weston Road Flows" comes close, with the great Mary J. Blige sample running through the track, but stumbles when Drake name drops Katy Perry and brags about wrecking marriages. The track, like so many others made up of over-blown boasts, seems to be fighting a battle that was won long ago. Drake has not only arrived, he's taken over. And if he's never going to get the same respect that someone like Chance the Rapper gets, making records as self-pitying and self-serving as Views isn't going to do much to further Drake's career artistically, either. Basically, Drake needs to lighten up and add some new colors to the paintbox, whether it’s songs about something other than his bummer love life (like the good times before the inevitable breakup), or the fabulous things that come from all the money and fame he never lets anyone forget he's accrued. Eventually, people will get tired of the same old song if it's sung too often. On Views, Drake is starting to sound a little weary of it himself.© Tim Sendra /TiVo	16	CD	2026-01-18 21:59:16.620904	2
271873	Five Leaves Left	Nick Drake	99.14	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/48/99/0060253759948_600.jpg	qobuz:12738446|0060253759948	It's little wonder why Drake felt frustrated at the lack of commercial success his music initially gathered, considering the help he had on his debut record. Besides fine production from Joe Boyd and assistance from folks like Fairport Convention's Richard Thompson and his unrelated bass counterpart from Pentangle, Danny Thompson, Drake also recruited school friend Robert Kirby to create most of the just-right string and wind arrangements. His own performance itself steered a careful balance between too-easy accessibility and maudlin self-reflection, combining the best of both worlds while avoiding the pitfalls on either side. The result was a fantastic debut appearance, and if the cult of Drake consistently reads more into his work than is perhaps deserved, Five Leaves Left is still a most successful effort. Having grown out of the amiable but derivative styles captured on the long-circulating series of bootleg home recordings, Drake imbues his tunes with just enough drama -- world-weariness in the vocals, carefully paced playing, and more -- to make it all work. His lyrics capture a subtle poetry of emotion, as on the pastoral semi-fantasia of "The Thoughts of Mary Jane," which his soft, articulate singing brings even more to the full. Sometimes he projects a little more clearly, as on the astonishing voice-and-strings combination "Way to Blue," while elsewhere he's not so clear, suggesting rather than outlining the mood. Understatement is the key to his songs and performances' general success, which makes the combination of his vocals and Rocky Dzidzornu's congas on "Three Hours" and the lovely "'Cello Song," to name two instances, so effective. Danny Thompson is the most regular side performer on the album, his bass work providing subtle heft while never standing in the way of the song -- kudos well deserved for Boyd's production as well.© Ned Raggett /TiVo	9	CD	2026-01-18 21:59:16.620906	2

826804	Honestly, Nevermind (Explicit version)	Drake	70.05	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/4b/bd/viif4wkvabd4b_600.jpg	qobuz:162076383|viif4wkvabd4b	One of the underrated aspects of Drake's charm is his prowess as a vocalist. Paired with the right mood or set of lyrics, he can conjure up a pretty convincing case that he's something of an R&B visionary. On the albums leading up to 2022's Honestly, Nevermind, Drake seemed to mostly forget his status, focusing mainly on rapping over dragging trap beats and only rarely showing off his skills as a singer. Amazingly, at some point prior to the recording of the album, trap fever seems to have broken and some different flavors finally started to creep back into the mix. Working with an array of producers including longtime ally 40, Carnage, and Black Coffee, Drake touches on new sounds like house music and Baltimore club, delves into guitar jazz fleetingly, and only invites a couple guests along to contribute instead of the usual cast of hundreds. It makes for one of his most varied and interesting records, with a melancholy, slightly defensive lyrical viewpoint that's familiar to all who have ever heard a Drake song, but here it feels somehow like the words cut a little closer to the bone. Perhaps it's the fact that he keeps the focus pointed directly at himself and doesn't bring anyone else in to distract from his litany of desperate heartbreaks, bitter revenge fantasies, hurt feelings, and romantic betrayals. Unlike his recent albums where the listener might have felt locked in with no escape from the darker side of Drake's psyche thanks to the monochromatic production, here one could choose to ignore the deluge of self-pity and focus instead on the rollicking late-night house jams ("Texts Go Green"), slippery club ballads ("Flight's Booked" and the sample-damaged, Mr. Fingers-sounding "Massive"), bubbly summer tunes ("Down Hill"), and the slinky "Tie That Binds," which brings just a touch of Latin soul to the proceedings. Of course, it's never exactly fun, since there is a thick coat of ghostly synth pads and backing vocals pulling the clouds over any hint of sun. Nobody really comes to a Drake record for fun, though; they come for a mood, and this record delivers it fully, only wrapped in some new, almost bright threads. There are a few tracks where Drake does some rapping: the pumping Baltimore-influenced "Sticky" is the most fun, while the album-ending, 21 Savage-featuring "Jimmy Cooks" is typical boasty Drake, but since it's an outlier, it has a little more impact than when it's surrounded by 20 more of them. Honestly, Nevermind is a welcome development in the Drake saga, a left turn off what was starting to seem like an endless stretch of trap-heavy highway. The destination is still sad and self-involved, but at least the scenery is colorful and never boring. © Tim Sendra /TiVo	39	CD	2026-01-18 21:59:29.422664	2
715712	The Making Of Five Leaves Left	Nick Drake	180.25	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/aa/hb/w7xndm07shbaa_600.jpg	qobuz:329123659|w7xndm07shbaa	At the time of its release, Nick Drake's debut album was barely noticed, but over the ensuing decades, it has grown into a central text for modern singer-songwriters and sad boys alike. Melding literary introspection, intricate guitar work, and subtle orchestral arrangements, Five Leaves Left presented an aesthetic that seemed to emerge fully formed from an ethereal otherworld. It was, in fact, the product of hard work and creative evolution. From an early age, Drake showed precocious talent as a musician, writer, and athlete, and he later won a scholarship to Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge. Though he rarely attended lectures and became increasingly withdrawn during his university years, that time was pivotal, as it was there that he met arranger Robert Kirby, a classically trained student who would go on to orchestrate much of Five Leaves Left and its follow-up, Bryter Layter, with chamber-style arrangements that were a remarkable complement to Drake's introspective songwriting. During his time at Cambridge, Drake was also in contact with producer Joe Boyd, the head of Witchseason Productions (Fairport Convention, The Incredible String Band), who not only got him signed to Island Records, but also sat in the producers' chair for Five Leaves Left. Sessions for the album began in 1968—when Drake was just 20 years old—at Sound Techniques in London, a favored studio of the British folk-rock scene, and they were slow and occasionally tense. Not only was most of Five Leaves Left recorded with Drake singing and playing along with the string section, but his unique personality—both perfectionist and shy—required plenty of patience from everyone involved. Present during the sessions were fellow Witchseason compatriots John and Beverley Martyn, a husband and wife duo who were both enraptured by Drake's talent and eager to encourage—and protect—him. Although it took nearly a year to complete the recording, Island surprisingly did little to promote it, and coupled with Drake's refusal to tour, meant that it only gained some quiet admiration among critics and fellow musicians upon its initial release. This long-overdue box set tastefully curates a story about the album's genesis. While there have been occasional non-album cuts that have appeared on compilations over the years, The Making of Five Leaves Left presents the album alongside an expanded and mindfully organized selection of home demos, studio outtakes, and alternate takes. Kicking off with the legendary "Beverley Martyn reel"—a selection of recordings from the first sessions at Sound Techniques given to her a few years after Drake's death—the set opens quite dramatically with "Mayfair," one of Drake's most legendary non-album tracks. Lacking the full orchestration of the final album but still boasting incredible fidelity, "Mayfair" and the other five songs (including another legendary lost cut, "Strange Face"—a proto-version of "Cello Song") from this session present a believable alternate vision of what Five Leaves Left could have been: an interesting, if not altogether special, recording of a talented singer-songwriter.As Drake continues to work through the material in additional 1968 studio sessions, demos recorded in his Cambridge dorm (decidedly less high-fidelity, but no less revelatory) and then with multiple takes of nearly all of the album's songs, you can hear the album's—and Drake's—identity come into sharper focus. Hearing this development adds considerable dimensions, and also does a bit of welcome myth-busting. It presents Drake as an inquisitive, open-minded, and driven musician trying to hone his voice, rather than as some sad, ethereal angel who just fell to Earth. That humanity was what made—and continues to make—Nick Drake such a captivating musician, and this set is an excellent and admirable reflection of that very musician. © Jason Ferguson/Qobuz	8	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:59:29.422664	1

Coming off of his uneven Views and his eclectic playlist More Life, the Toronto artist offers a complete panel of 25 tracks spread over two sides like an old vinyl or a dusty tape. Drake is trying to explore all the angles of his musical personality, with a first ensemble focused on rap, and the other edging towards pop. In “Scorpion”, Drake is also trying to encompass his entire dynasty, and invited his two long-time role models to the party: Jay-Z for a red-hot verse and Michael Jackson on a ghostly melody. Darker and sharper in the first part, Drake reaches later on a few radiant moments like “Blue Tint” and “Ratchet Happy Birthday”. But for the first time in many years, the worldwide musical emperor appears to falter on his throne and offers a glimpse into a few fragile moments. Following Pusha T’s repeated attacks, Drake recognises his paternity maybe sooner than he initially intended. And while he often claims to be “Emotionless”, Aubrey Graham here proves he can’t always be in control. He appears urgent on the “Nonstop” borrowed from Blocboy JB, nostalgic on the soulful “8 out of 10” and annoyed on the catchy “Sandra’s Rose”, produced by DJ Premier. Bit by bit, he’s always trying to prove his legitimacy, justifying his success, his accomplishments. Scorpion marks a turning point in his discography, a transition with a few flashes and short-winded moments that scratch the surface of the artist’s personality. Throughout the album, Drake doesn’t directly address his critics, but provides a lot of information about his position and state of mind. Slick but tormented. The best Canadian mix. © Aurélien Chapuis/Qobuz	30	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:59:29.422657	1
639130	More Life	Drake	40.43	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/40/79/0060255757940_600.jpg	qobuz:39487623|0060255757940	After releasing the hugely popular but artistically underwhelming Views in 2016, Drake went back to the mixtape approach for his next release, 2017's More Life. Over the course of 22 songs and almost an hour and a half of music, Drake shows again why he's one of the most frustrating rappers in the world. The main problem is that he's a better hip-hop-inspired R&B singer than he is an R&B-inspired rapper, but he refuses to acknowledge it. Listening to track after track of molasses-slow trap featuring Drake going on about how once he was on the bottom and now is firmly cemented at the top is tiresome at best, painful at worst. He only really comes to life on the songs where he drops the hard façade and lets some of his emotion show through, like the lovely island-inflected groover "Get It Together," which features Jorja Smith killing it in the role often occupied by Rihanna, or the dark-night-of-the-soul ballad "Nothings into Somethings," which balances his intimate crooning with introspective rapping. The bubbling "Passionfruit" is Drake at his smooth, melancholy best, showing off his skill at creating surprising melodies and entrancing atmosphere. These moments are too few and far between and most of the record sits right in the center of the rut Drake has dug for himself over the years. There are some tracks that break free of the boredom and show some kind of pulse -- usually the tracks where guests drop by and add their skills to the mix. Young Thug, in particular. His dramatic rapping and outsized persona put Drake to shame on "Ice Melts." He's Technicolor, while Drake is various shades of gray. That track and Sampha's feature ("4422"), where the singer gets deeper emotionally than Drake ever has, don't do Drake any favors. They only serve to showcase his flaws and make it clear that More Life is another overly serious, musically uninteresting effort. The few choice tracks, high-profile guests, and occasional stylistic shifts aren't enough to keep More Life from being another disappointing release. That it proved immensely popular upon its release will only serve to reinforce his misguided belief that he's the best rapper around.© Tim Sendra /TiVo	18	CD	2026-01-18 21:59:29.422662	2
447414	Take Care	Drake	75.77	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/66/04/0060253700466_600.jpg	qobuz:5176756|0060253700466	Drake’s highly anticipated follow up to the platinum Thank Me Later is full to the brim. Made up of beautiful contradictions, tender vocals, tight flows and big name collaborations, Take Care is a more than worthy successor to the Toronto rapper’s first studio album. Amongst the 19 tracks on the album are collaborations with the likes of Rihanna, The Weeknd, Kendrick Lamar, Rick Ross, Nicki Minaj, Lil Wayne and even Stevie Wonder (a harmonica solo on Doing It Wrong). Drake lays everything on the table here, displaying everything from sheer confidence (Headlines, HYFR) to mellow and fragile insights into his love life (Marvins Room, Doing It Wrong). The mix of deep, soulful singing and sharp rapping is what makes this album brilliant, and these two aspects don’t remain separated as Drake often combines the two in order to make his raps more melodic, something that has given him a more original sound during his rise to the top. Take Care also steps it up in terms of production with a team including T-Minus, 40, Jamie xx, Boi-1da, The Weeknd, Illangelo, Doc McKinney and Supa Dups. Despite the generally ambient style, the extensive list of producers makes for a reasonably diverse mix of techniques, influences (in terms of genre) and tempos.There are certainly some rap classics in waiting on Take Care, including the title track on which Drake and Rihanna play the love game by exchanging heartfilled verses over Jamie xx’s production. Headlines and Crew Love (featuring the Weeknd) have “hit” written all over them with their hard-hitting and confidence filled lyrics. Marvins Room soothes the soul with its tender vocals and jealousy driven lyrics, a classic emotionally charged (lost) love song. Drake and his mentor Lil Wayne shrug off all the meaningless questions coming their way on HYFR, a track radiating swagger. And finally he concludes the album with The Motto (featuring Lil Wayne and Tyga), a piece of pure rap brilliance. By the looks of things, Drake is settling into his status as a superstar nicely. © Euan Decourt/Qobuz	31	CD	2026-01-18 21:59:29.422662	2
604406	Certified Lover Boy	Drake	75.49	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/6a/vn/yutqo6x1pvn6a_600.jpg	qobuz:130393118|yutqo6x1pvn6a	Since 2016 and his fourth album Views, Drake has changed dimension and his artistic direction. Seeking the musical hit, often with brilliance, allowing all his influences to bloom on his mixtape More Life in 2017 or dividing the critics with Dark Lane Demo Tapes in 2020, here he is returning to his first loves. Certified Lover Boy is frontal and gargantuan in terms of lyrics as Drake has something to say. Starting with settling scores with Kanye West or with the industry. But after the storm comes the calm, as with the tracks Pipe Down or 7am On A Bridle Path, these are the moments when the Canadian can leave aside the discursive to at last please himself, and to explore what he does best. On the first tracks such as Champagne Theory or Papi’s Home, Drake has superbly placed Certified Lover Boy under the sampling prism. But that is only a foretaste. For when he summons Metro Boomin to perform in Knife Talk or the trap bosses Future and Young Thug on Way 2 Sexy, he cuts to the essential, looks ahead and makes this album one of his best releases since 2015. © Brice Miclet/Qobuz	34	CD	2026-01-18 21:59:29.422662	2

This, of course, made it Drake's first album since his well-publicized feud with Kendrick Lamar, who seems to have been crowned the victor by fans and critics. Nevertheless, Drake's fan base is still large enough for the album to top the charts in Canada and the United States, and one imagines that many of Drake's supporters are unfazed by the whole ordeal. $ome $exy $ongs 4 U is business as usual for Drake (mostly in R&B mode this time) and PartyNextDoor. In Drake's case, he tries to sound romantic but comes off as bitter and jealous, PartyNextDoor merely seems like a supportive friend who doesn't want to cause any more trouble. There are a few stylistic diversions, such as an appearance by Mexican singer/songwriter Chino Pacas on "Meet Your Padre," an acoustic bedroom R&B interlude by a singer named Pimmie, and the strummy, radio-ready pop of "Die Trying" (featuring Yebba). Overall, though, the album is just another overlong pity party that won't mean much to anyone who isn't already on Drake's side.© TiVo Staff /TiVo	8	CD	2026-01-18 21:59:29.422663	2

Demonstrating the abilities shown on Five Leaves Left didn't consist of a fluke, Bryter Layter featured another set of exquisitely arranged and performed tunes, with producer Joe Boyd and orchestrator Robert Kirby reprising their roles from the earlier release. Starting with the elegant instrumental "Introduction," as lovely a mood-setting piece as one would want, Bryter Layter indulges in a more playful sound at many points, showing that Drake was far from being a constant king of depression. While his performances remain generally low-key and his voice quietly passionate, the arrangements and surrounding musicians add a considerable amount of pep, as on the jazzy groove of the lengthy "Poor Boy." The argument could be made that this contravenes the spirit of Drake's work, but it feels more like a calmer equivalent to the genre-sliding experiments of Van Morrison at around the same time. Numbers that retain a softer approach, like "At the Chime of a City Clock," still possess a gentle drive to them. Cale's additions unsurprisingly favor the classically trained side of his personality, with particularly brilliant results on "Northern Sky." As his performances on keyboards and celeste help set the atmosphere, Drake reaches for a perfectly artful reflection on loss and loneliness and succeeds wonderfully.© Ned Raggett /TiVo	19	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:59:29.422663	1

He delivers an album with flow in line with the rap blockbusters of the early 2020s, which rely on the opulence of their tracks, almost like outward signs of wealth. Far from going into autopilot, Drake explores an incalculable number of sound paradigms, his finger on the pulse of the latest trends, venturing into the emo rants of Yeat, who he features on  “IDGAF,” and into loops of dark samples on the hard hitting single “First Person,” where J. Cole also spits fire. With a touch of playfulness and mischief, the Canadian turns himself into a grimey schoolboy, shooting at anything that moves to settle the score and establish his dominance, then gets in his feelings on the very boom bap “8am in Charlotte.” For All the Dogs is a wiry, complex album, a deep dive into the psyche and the innumerable artistic desires of its artist. © Brice Miclet/Qobuz	19	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:59:29.422663	1
220224	Her Loss	Drake	186.8	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/cc/fg/j3hcdvxe7fgcc_600.jpg	qobuz:183761457|j3hcdvxe7fgcc	Sometimes, simple is better. For their joint album Her Loss, Drake and 21 Savage have created 16 raw and unembellished tracks. There’s nothing calculated about this release; there’s no desire to push a musical agenda. There’s just a tangible yearning to lay down some fearsomely produced tracks concocted by a plethora of beatmakers, including Metro Boomin, Nyan, Earl On The Beat and Tay Keith. The sound of Atlanta–21 Savage’s stronghold–resonates throughout the album. Drake, as usual, is a chameleon, trying out new flows whilst his accomplice talks about madness and audacious ego trips in a deceptively calm voice. Reading between the lines, it seems to be women that are the source of all their ills. Both of them project their desires for revenge and deception with unbridled, sleazy romanticism. There are tremendous tracks like ‘Spin Bout U’ with its slick production and ‘BackOutsideBoyz’ with its muffled beats. There’s even a sample taken from Daft Punk’s hit ‘One More Time’ on ‘Circo Loco’, seeing Drake take another (albeit discreet) step towards house music. Her Loss is a huge release. © Brice Miclet/Qobuz	25	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:59:29.422665	1
394282	If You're Reading This It's Too Late	Drake	295.52	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/91/61/0060254726191_600.jpg	qobuz:22602590|0060254726191	After a typically busy and fascinating 2014, Drake's 2015 started off much the same way. His chart-topping "album" If You're Reading This It's Too Late started off life as a free mixtape, but his label Cash Money stepped in at the last minute and changed it to a full-priced release. This move came amid reports that Drake was ready to follow his mentor Lil Wayne and leave Cash Money because of money issues. The album's number of references to not getting paid by his label shows that even if the rumors end up being false, Drake was plenty upset with Birdman and his business practices while he was recording this tape. Drake is also mad at women trying to play him for a fool, rappers who diss him, and people who think he's soft. Par for the course for a Drake album lately, but the difference here is that there are no pop singles to balance the claustrophobic rants. There are also no huge radio hooks, and most of the album sounds like it was cooked up (mostly by old mates Noah "40" Shebib and Boi-1da) during sleepless nights behind drawn blinds, with more dank atmosphere than the coach cabin of a passenger jet after an 18-hour flight. His raps sport the same snappy wordplay as usual, but Drake sounds like he's rapping to himself this time out, trying to work out issues and feelings instead of broadcasting to the world. He occasionally breaks out of the murk to make some noise, like on the strutting "6 God," but mostly he keeps his head down and the mood subdued. It makes for an album that's hard to love right away, but if you stick with it, is a rewarding listen. Especially at the end of the mixtape/album when Drake drops three songs that would have been highlights on any of his albums (or anyone's albums for that matter). The heartbreaking conversation with/ode to his mother "You & the 6," the slow-motion Prince-inspired R&B ballad "Jungle," and the swaggering "6PM in New York" sound like the core of what could have been his best album. As it is, they are a stunningly good coda to a very confusing detour in his career.© Tim Sendra /TiVo	37	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:59:29.422665	1
990279	Dark Lane Demo Tapes (Explicit)	Drake	375.35	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/bb/0e/unaj2we1h0ebb_600.jpg	qobuz:93476967|unaj2we1h0ebb	Since the 2010s undeniably belonged to Drake, the dominant figure in pop music, sales and impact, the way in which he would kick off the the 20s was highly anticipated. With Dark Lane Demo Tapes, his most recent mixtape since More Life released three years before (and between the two, the album Scorpion), the Toronto native’s game-plan is clear: directly address the listener with a certain romanticism, invite along some heavyweights (Future, Playboi Carti and even Chris Brown), and take the opportunity to settle some scores. There’re few surprises on this new project, and after all, why must there be? Drake is in autopilot and what we are have here is an offering to fans. Despite strong tracks like Time Flies, or the drill production on Demons (featuring big name on the contemporary drill scene, Fivio Foreign), Dark Lane Demo Tapes is not going to change anyone’s opinion of Drake. Nevertheless, Drake’s choice is clear: instead of elaborating individual tracks he has chosen to string together instrumentals while rambling over the top of them. It’s a mixtape after all, not an album. In this format, it’s often easier to make use of production that is more plainly rap. It’s therefore not too contentious to say that the stand-out tracks on the record, from War to Desires (featuring Future) and D4L (with Young Thug and Future once again), are those that are less sung. Awaiting the next album then. © Brice Miclet/Qobuz	18	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:59:29.422666	1
181652	So Far Gone	Drake	45.02	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/sb/vi/q0xmb5t3rvisb_600.jpg	qobuz:59089608|q0xmb5t3rvisb	So Far So Gone is Drake’s third mixtape. Ten years after its release online, it is now ready for its second life. When the mixtape was released Drake was most known for his part in the Canadian show Degrassi: The Next Generation. He had already produced two mixtapes, still quite unknown, and had just released his sensational single Best I Ever Had. The song attracted various labels who after the release of So Far Gone fought over his contract. The recipe adopted here by Drake and his faithful beatmakers Noah “40” Shebib and Boi-1da is unstoppable: irresistible vocal melodies, between rap and singing, supported by spacious and airy beats, full of references to southern hip-hop (November 18th, a tribute to DJ Screw, Uptown), featured appearances of the godfather Lil Wayne (on November 18th) and subtle nods to rap and indie pop hits (Santigold and Diplo, Jay-Z and Lykke Li). Music fans from all over the world were discovering Drake’s double persona, both arrogant and vulnerable. A prelude for one of the most spectacular cross-over success of the times, “So Far So Gone”, goes further in the direction opened by Kanye West with 808's & Heartbreak.It also paved the way for a new generation of rapper-crooners including The Weeknd and Frank Ocean. © Damien Besançon/Qobuz	22	CD	2026-01-18 21:59:29.422666	2
418777	Jazz at Berlin Philharmonic XVII: Gnawa World Blues	Majid Bekkas	216.16	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/sc/vl/motkj46byvlsc_600.jpg	qobuz:324886445|motkj46byvlsc	Since 2014, the ACT label’s series Jazz at Berlin Philharmonic highlights the profoundly eclectic jazz programming that takes place every autumn at the legendary concert hall, considered one of the classical music world’s most prestigious. Recorded in November 2024, this 17th installment is dedicated to an encounter between Moroccan musician Majid Bekkas on guembri, oud, and vocals, French-Vietnamese guitarist Nguyên Lê, and the Chicago-born Hamid Drake. These three adventurers of the contemporary music world have taken it upon themselves to use their respective cultural and musical origins in order to extend the common ground between jazz, rock, and world music. Having already formed a bond through multiple prior collaborations (the Bekkas/Lê duo had already appeared on Jazz at Berlin Philharmonic X: East-West in 2000, while Bekkas and Drake provided the rhythm section on Peter Brötzmann’s album Catching Ghosts, recorded at JazzFest Berlin in 2022), the three musicians’ powerfully organic, festive music masterfully reinterprets the Gnawa tradition (“Mrahba,” “Sidi Bouganga”), combining it with Delta blues (with a mind-blowing cover of the John Lee Hooker classic “Boom Boom Boom”) and the (free) rock of the 60s and 70s (Jimi Hendrix’s “Purple Haze”). The mesmerizing flourishes of the oud and guembri merge with the sophisticated harmonies and abrasive sonorities of a decidedly lyrical electric guitar, as the simultaneously fluid and pulsing percussion dishes out an extraordinary array of grooves. The project gives each musician the opportunity to enrich their collective discourse with their own culture, all while freeing themselves of whatever constraints their respective backgrounds may otherwise entail. The music that results from these different traditions coming into contact with one another, welcoming each other with open arms for a true “meeting of the minds,” transcends geographic, stylistic, and cultural borders. © Stéphane Ollivier/Qobuz	11	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:59:29.422666	1
870565	The Endless Coloured Ways: The Songs of Nick Drake	Nick Drake	345.82	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/3b/l6/lpozhsn4xl63b_600.jpg	qobuz:214006606|lpozhsn4xl63b	In 1992, British indie label Imaginary put together Brittle Days, a Nick Drake tribute album featuring a wonderfully diverse slate of acts ranging from Shelleyan Orphan and the High Llamas to Loop and Nikki Sudden. While this was a full eight years before an ad agency placed "Pink Moon" in a Volkswagen Cabrio commercial and made Drake one of the most well-known "undiscovered" artists around, it was right in the middle of a then-current craze for tribute albums that alternative acts used to make explicit their roster of influences. And among indie and alternative artists of that late '80s/early '90s era, Nick Drake was a widely shared touchstone, thanks to the 1986 Fruit Tree box set that packaged up the entirety of his recorded output at an affordable price. So it wasn't terribly surprising that Brittle Days was one of a few Drake tributes that would emerge over the next few years. As his legacy has become more required reading rather than sui generis discovery, it's been a while since another truly inspiring collection of Drake covers has been released. Endless Coloured Ways ends that drought in an exceptional manner. Spearheaded by the Drake estate, this sprawling collection features 23 of Drake's songs reimagined by a wildly broad selection of artists, from likely candidates such as David Gray, Skullcrusher, Ben Harper, and Feist to more surprising appearances from the likes of Craig Armstrong, Liz Phair, and Emeli Sandé. The lineup is even more rewarding than it would appear at first, kaleidoscopic sight: Instead of getting all these unique voices to bend their musical style in homage to Drake's sound, the approach is refreshingly catholic, resulting in two albums' worth of Nick Drake songs that sound nothing like Nick Drake. While the original spirit of the tunes is largely respected—no death metal "Parasite"—and the lyrics and melodies are intact, each artist delivers their own unique arrangements, sonic predilections, and particular weirdnesses to the proceedings. To be sure, there are a few artists who just kinda sound like a '70s singer-songwriter (looking at you Ben Harper), but for the most part, things are much more adventurous and unexpected, as this album unfolds across its "four seasons" of material. Whether it's Fontaines D.C.'s epic, ripping sonics on "Cello Song," the sensitive glitch-folk of Radiohead's Philip Selway doing "Fly," or Norwegian electropop artist Aurora turning "Pink Moon" into atmospheric synth futurism, the material here often veers far away from Drake's sonic approach. Instead, it manages to stay tightly connected to the original's aesthetic truth, a true hallmark of a successful tribute album. © Jason Ferguson/Qobuz	34	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:59:29.422666	1

It's a 17-track collection of songs recorded but not used on albums or mixtapes, stretching back to the Take Care era in 2011. Many of the songs were used as teasers for upcoming projects, dangling out in front of the rabid public to get them excited. Ironically a lot of those tracks proved to be just as good as those actually used on the albums themselves. While that might have been disappointing to people wondering why they weren't included at the time, it does mean that Care Package is a surprisingly strong collection. It gathers up pounding, angry tracks like "Dreams Money Can Buy" from 2011 that shows Drake's rap skills were always sharp, lots of atmospheric late-night R&B, a bit of freewheeling hip-hop, and some slickly smooth balladry as on "Heat of the Moment." The tracks range from dark and introspective to loose and humorous ("Draft Day") with some biting diss tracks ("4pm in Calabasas," which rips on Puffy, Meek Mill, and Joe Budden), crooning remakes of TLC's "Fan Mail" ("I Get Lonely") and the Destiny's Child song "Say My Name" ("Girls Love Beyoncé"), and some avant-garde R&B ("My Side"). Through it all, the familiar Drake tropes (his self-belief, his rise from nowhere to the top, his broken heart and disdain for the people who did him wrong) are front and center, but unlike on recent albums where the sameness of the music and tone makes for difficult listening, the variety of styles, sounds, and beats means that this is one of the more satisfying albums Drake has issued. Despite it being made up of songs that were cast off, leaked, or used as bait, it serves as a kind of shadow career overview that gives a full picture of Drake as a talented, forward-thinking, frustrating, monomaniacal, and important artist.© Tim Sendra /TiVo	38	CD	2026-01-18 21:59:29.422667	2

Travis Scott makes his comeback six years after Astroworld, the crowning achievement of a rise that seemed it would stop at nothing, before colliding with some serious problems with the law and his conscience. He sunk to a very low point, some felt nearing the end of his career. But here he is now, patching up his statute as the heavyweight of the 2010s with this fourth album, aided and abetted by such pundits of the genre as Mike Dean, WondaGurl, Jahaan Sweet and Kanye West (whose influence is obvious). It was a gamble, but one that paid off. Blended with rock and industrial influences, Utopia is first and foremost about big sound, the kind that hits you square in the chest. From Hyaena to the superb Modern Jam (produced by Guy-Man from Daft), from Lost Forever to the whopping single K-Pop, Travis Scott superbly restores his reputation, aided by an army of prestigious featuring artists (Beyoncé, The Weekend, James Blake, Drake, Yung Lean, Playboi Carti...) and his unbridled vocal imagination. © Brice Miclet/Qobuz	27	CD	2026-01-18 21:59:32.086384	2

After a complete dominance over the rap world and global hits like Pick Up The Phone, Goosebumps and Antidote, the rapper from Houston had a singular ambition for this ASTROWORLD, an album that was postponed several times. A choral manifesto whose result is up to the phenomenon. The album is a logical series of spurious and harrowing collages. Travis here rather poses as a curator or an art director than a total artist. He easily blends samples to concoct his own formula, an unstoppable musical behemoth. Uncredited guests are treated like samples in this massive explosive cocktail, despite the fact that they are some of the biggest names in the business, among whom Drake, 21Savage, The Weeknd, Frank Ocean and Stevie Wonder. This complete levelling of sources and tributes turn ASTROWORLD into a completely polymorphic work, both a mainstream blockbuster and a modern artsy piece. Already a few months old, his hit song BUTTERFLY EFFECT fully blends in, as if the album absorbed all the energies to spit out a single colour. Other tracks like SICKO MOB or NOBYSTANDERS sound like hit songs in the making, despite their complex structure. At the crossroads of sometimes diverging paths, Travis Scott creates a unique balance that could please both the mainstream public and music lovers keen on obscure references. Merrily switching from DJ Screw to the Kardashians, ASTROWORLD is the soundtrack of our times, an impeccable musical maze, vain at times, but in which listeners can delightfully lose themselves. And yet, Travis’ identity is yet to be uncovered within the plethora of strings and borrowed sounds. ASTROWORLD is a great sci-fi flick in which the replicant becomes the norm, the new musical human. © Aurélien Chapuis/Qobuz	14	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:59:45.198654	1

"Pick Up the Phone" functioned as the lead single off Thug's JEFFERY, and it sensibly reappears here, buried in the latter half, de-emphasized yet not quite a tacked-on bonus. It's easily the track with the most pop appeal on Scott's second full-length. Released almost exactly a year after Rodeo, Birds in the Trap features little development, though the large company Scott keeps is quite different, and Metro Boomin is noticeably absent. Among the present is André 3000, who drops by on "The Ends" to recollect the infamous rash of murders that struck his city during his early childhood. The album's deepest verse by a great measure, it has no discernible connection to Scott's surrounding rhymes of cocksure nonsense. That remains the M.O. of Scott, who remains deeply into heavy accessorization and proclamations of dominance, as well as punctuations with affirmative exclamations cast in dehumanizing pitch alteration. Swarming basslines and sluggish beats likewise form the rhythmic foundation, with gauzy and tickling keyboards adding sweetness to Scott's hedonistic hooks. Only on "Guidance," through scuttling drums granted by DF, is there a significant shake-up. This time, Scott co-produced only one track, another Weeknd collaboration, and it easily slips into the album's scheme with its serpentine menace and lightweight lyricism. Among the others on the guest carousel are Kendrick Lamar, Kid Cudi, 21 Savage, and Cassie. They all pass in a slow-motion blur.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	22	CD	2026-01-18 21:59:45.198659	2

Much like J. Cole's Dreamville label or Lil Wayne's Young Money roster before that, Cactus Jack allows Scott to slowly build an empire in his own image, offering a platform for new artists he handpicks. The brief Jackboys compilation acts as an introduction to the Cactus Jack roster in its earliest stages. Though it spans only a slim seven tracks and 21-minute running time, the scant material is packed with big-name appearances and attention-grabbing performances from the new Cactus Jack signees. There's a feature from Young Thug on the slithering flute-loop driven "Out West" as well as established stars like Rosalía, Offset, and Lil Baby stopping by on various songs. Cactus Jack newcomers Sheck Wes, Luxury Tax, and Don Toliver trade verses with Scott on "Gang Gang," and Toliver stands out on the mournfully soulful "Had Enough" and the ominous "What to Do?" Jackboys is multifaceted even in its brevity. The seven tracks move across druggy trap vibes, brooding emo rap hooks, and bravado-heavy bangers like the Pop Smoke-featuring closer "Gatti." The various creative directions are cohesive enough to gel, but the songs rush by in a flash, making Jackboys feel less like an introduction to an exciting new label and more like a sneak preview of what's to come.© Fred Thomas /TiVo	8	CD	2026-01-18 21:59:45.198661	2

Brewing anticipation for his imminent debut album, Rodeo, Scott's DAYS BEFORE RODEO is the project's darker, more erratic predecessor, capturing the rawness of Scott's pioneering sound in all of its gloom. While tracks like "Quintana, Pt. 2" and "Sloppy Toppy" are the kinds of fierce, Auto-Tuned anthems you'd expect from a mid-2010s Southern trap star, DBR really kicks in when things get a little darker: the harpsichord of "Don't Play" oozes the gothic flair associated with Scott's public image, "Skyfall" builds a madhouse of circus-like synths and ominous layered chants, and Wondagurl bookmarks "The Prayer" with funeral-march organs and discordant vocal chops. The cruising "Backyard" and "Grey" pull things down a notch for a smoke session-friendly closer, to say nothing of the magnificent "Drugs You Should Try It," an ephemeral experience that might be as close to soundtracking a high as rap has ever achieved. There's a singularity to what Scott has managed to capture here, a blend of urgency and brooding energy with siftings of the Southern gothic -- something critical caught in motion.Re-released for its tenth anniversary in 2024, DAYS BEFORE RODEO was bolstered by the addition of five iconic unreleased tracks, completing demos that had been passed around fan circles online for over five years. The biggest initial surprise is the completed version of "Mo City Flexologist," a track whose unreleased status was at one point a running joke in Scott's die-hard following. Alongside the hotly awaited "Serenade" and "Too Many Chances," the pinnacle of the bunch proves to be kinetic Young Thug collaboration "Yeah Yeah," with its time-warping opening as Scott croons "If I take these xans, would you cancel all your plans?" When it finally locks into step, Travis and Thug are at the peak of their powers, flowing in concentric rings around the track's vital, shimmering pulse. While Thugger's frenetic last verse sadly misses the final cut, the track remains not just one of Scott's best but one of the most intoxicating in the entire scene.© David Crone /TiVo	30	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:59:45.198661	1

The psychedelic trap sound that brought Scott chart domination on his 2018 album, Astroworld, gets smoothed out into new forms of tense, atmospheric rap with big-screen production aided by a guest list made up of some of the biggest names in music. Scott is in full-on Kanye mode throughout UTOPIA. The pulsing percussion and thick bass of "Circus Maximus" feel like a direct callback to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, the burning synths of "Modern Jam" or shattered, distorted beats of songs like "Sirens" reference Yeezus, and other subtle nods to various moments of West's influence are peppered throughout. West himself lends production to parts of the album and is just one of many on UTOPIA's staggering list of world-famous contributors. Drake adds a seething verse to "Meltdown," Beyonce sings over the majority of doomy house-influenced track "Delresto (Echoes)," The Weeknd and 21 Savage are both on multiple tracks, and there are also appearances by Bad Bunny, SZA, Young Thug, Kid Cudi, Bon Iver's Justin Vernon, Dave Chappelle, and many others. UTOPIA feels like a concerted effort on Scott's part to both expand his artistic range and turn in a timeless statement similar to the Kanye albums he's clearly inspired by. While the album might ultimately not be as fully realized as it would need to be to rank among history's best, Scott's fearless exploration of new sounds and styles is what keeps UTOPIA interesting. There are experiments with ambience, risky beat switches, theatrical and hook-free pop, and orchestration that Scott has never attempted before. The multi-platinum guest features might set the album up for global conquest, but the most exciting moments come when it sounds like Scott is discovering a new way to push his craft forward.© TiVo Staff /TiVo	38	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:59:45.198663	1
659884	Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho	Huncho Jack	234.22	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/xc/xs/kk6yz0k7uxsxc_600.jpg	qobuz:46176241|kk6yz0k7uxsxc	Huncho Jack, Jack Huncho (HJJH), the first collaborative LP between trap heavyweights Quavo and Travis Scott, can be aptly summarized by its opener, "Modern Slavery." Immediately wheeling out a warm, reverberant Otis Redding sample, the track sets the stage for something grandiose, a promise doubly reinforced by its evocative title. It quickly becomes apparent, however, that all is for show: The sample's simmering soul is quickly shoehorned into an aimless loop before Quavo appears in limp Auto-Tune, giving up on rhyme entirely with the clunky "Never been food for sharks/Wrist like fins on dolphins." There is little to salvage here, as the track's remaining two minutes are rolled out with utter tedium, a boiling pot of bland Auto-Tune, freestyle writing, and static loops. What "Modern Slavery" demonstrates so aptly is the album's core failing, a lack of focus. Despite some excellent musical frameworks and concepts, the pair put no effort into utilizing them to create great music. Yung Lean's ethereal opener on "Dubai Shit" is quickly discarded for a monotonous 4-note beat, while the gloomy production of "Motorcycle Patches" is thrown under the bus by Scott's tuneless "fuck shit up, we fuck shit up." This fundamental lack of care is equally reflected in the album's writing, arguably the worst of either artist's career. While trap is hardly renowned for poetry, HJJH's content is markedly poor: phrases like "wait for the swag to unlock" are cringe-worthy, while "We was tribe, Navajo/We was real, Jack and Jill/Like the pill had awoke" is just nonsensical. Although a punchy delivery could mask this significantly sub-par writing, the pair opt instead for a humming Auto-Tune, slathering their verses with robotic filters. While this works to their strength in the atmospheric layering of "Moon Rock" and "Where U From," for the most part it further lobotomizes the tracks, gutting them of any variance or flair. Even "Best Man," a dedication to the pair's close associates, is delivered in an emotionless daze.The album's redeeming moments come mainly at the hands of Scott; when he's able to adapt his cadences to suit production needs, his choruses grant the verses a fundamental momentum. The sticky hooks on "Saint" and "Black & Chinese" propel their verses forward, with Scott inhabiting infectious pockets in the beat to allow the pair to rattle off flows with ease. It is Scott who provides the album's sole gem, too, in the brooding "Moon Rock." A reminder of Scott's mixtape material, the track's stabbing chords and layered strings give the beat a hazy, gothic atmosphere reminiscent of Days Before Rodeo. While Quavo brings the energy throughout his final verse, it is Scott's gloomy tales that steal the show: "know that you n*ggas never liked me/Know that you n*ggas sit beside me tryna slide on my side piece" is delivered with perfect disdain. Yet for the brilliance of "Moon Rock," HJJH remains an exercise in disappointment. While moments of excellence occur in many of the project's tracks, the album's drawling vocals, static song structures, and Auto-Tune overkill doom it to failure, creating a lifeless project that verges on parody. This is a cobbled-together effort, and it shows.© David Crone /TiVo	18	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:59:45.198665	1
584064	Renaissance	Beyoncé	387.13	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/kc/ab/t8v2gctijabkc_600.jpg	qobuz:162476874|t8v2gctijabkc	Never before has Beyoncé made her fans wait so long between solo albums. Of course, these past six and a half years haven’t been easy for the singer—far from it. However, such levels of anticipation inevitably lead to impatience. After unveiling the house-pop influenced single Break My Soul, which definitely came as a surprise, you’d be forgiven for expecting her new album to be something more along the lines of Drake’s Honestly, Nevermind released a month prior, but it’s nothing of the sort. Renaissance has electronic rhythms at its core, but it’s extremely wide-ranging. Beyoncé flirts with disco-funk on Cuff It, summons huge choirs fit for a queen on Cozy, and includes a new ode to feminist empowerment with Church Girl (which gives an insight into her soul and gospel influences). Perhaps the best musical synthesis on the album is found in the track Virgo’s Groove, reviving the Latin sounds that feature on Move and Heated. With Renaissance, Beyoncé has really upped her pace, creating a highspeed musical freeway that’ll take you to a lot of different places. © Brice Miclet/Qobuz	30	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:00:00.757791	1
264495	Dangerously In Love	Beyoncé	102.31	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/24/86/0696998638624_600.jpg	qobuz:97459|0696998638624	Beyoncé Knowles was always presented as the star of Destiny's Child -- which probably shouldn't be a big surprise since her father managed the group. So it was a natural step for her to step into the diva spotlight with a solo album in 2003, particularly since it followed on the heels of her co-starring role in Mike Myers' 2002 comedy hit, Austin Powers in Goldmember. Still, a singer takes a risk when going solo, as there's no guarantee that her/his star will still shine as bright when there's nobody to reflect upon. Plus, Survivor often sounded labored, as Knowles struggled to sound real. The Knowles clan -- Beyoncé and her father Mathew, that is (regrettably, Harry Knowles of "Ain't It Cool" is no relation) -- were apparently aware of these two pitfalls since they pull off a nifty trick of making her debut album, Dangerously in Love, appeal to a broad audience while making it sound relatively easy. Sometimes that ease can translate into carelessness (at least with regard to the final stretch of the album), with a prolonged sequence of ballads that get stuck in their own treacle, capped off by the unbearably mawkish closer, "Gift from Virgo," where she wishes her unborn child and her husband to be like her daddy. (Mind you, she's not pregnant or married, she's just planning ahead, although she gets tripped up in her wishes since there's "no one else like my daddy.") Although these are a little formless -- and perhaps would have been more digestible if spread throughout the record -- they are impeccably produced and showcase Knowles' new relaxed and smooth delivery, which is a most welcome development after the overworked Survivor. Knowles doesn't save this voice just for the ballads -- she sounds assured and sexy on the dance numbers, particularly when she has a male counterpart, as on the deliriously catchy "Crazy in Love" with her man Jay-Z or on "Baby Boy" with 2003's dancehall superstar, Sean Paul. These are the moments when Dangerously in Love not only works, but sounds like Knowles has fulfilled her potential and risen to the top of the pack of contemporary R&B divas. It's just too bad that momentum is not sustained throughout the rest of the record. About halfway through, around the astrological ode "Signs" with Missy Elliott, it starts crawling through its ballads and, while listenable, it's not as exciting as the first part of the record. Still, the first half is good enough to make Dangerously in Love one of the best mainstream urban R&B records released in 2003, and makes a strong case that Knowles might be better off fulfilling this destiny instead of reuniting with Destiny.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	34	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:00:00.757794	1
646016	Lemonade (Explicit)	Beyoncé	151.41	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/db/s8/pkzf16ih1s8db_600.jpg	qobuz:61281791|pkzf16ih1s8db	Beyoncé's sixth album loomed once "Formation" and its video were issued ahead of the superstar's Super Bowl 50 half-time performance. Two months and a couple weeks later, it appeared as a culturally seismic visual album. Loaded with layers of meaning and references, and experienced en masse through its televised premiere, Lemonade honored black sisterhood with the presence of Warsan Shire, Serena Williams, and the mothers of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Eric Garner. Subsequently given audio-only release, its title comes from a popular proverb given extra personal relevance by Beyoncé's grandmother-in-law, whose citation is heard here during a crucial moment in the sequence. Mrs. Knowles-Carter indeed turns her own lemons into Lemonade. She uses the platform to demand contrition from her adulterous partner, assert her excellence, reflect upon the bonds with the men in her life, and their relationships with other women, and wonders if her trust can be earned back. The cathartic and wounded moments here resonate in a manner matched by few, if any, of Beyoncé's contemporaries. She sometimes eclipses herself in terms of raw emotion, as on the throttling Jack White encounter "Don't Hurt Yourself." At the low-volume end, there's more power in the few seconds she chokes back tears while singing "Come back" -- timed with the backing vocal in Isaac Hayes' version of "Walk on By" -- than there is in most contemporary ballads. Romantic conflict is nothing new for her, but there is a degree of concentration and specificity, and an apparent disregard for appealing to commercial radio that makes Lemonade a distinct addition to her catalog. (Another distinguishing factor is the length of credits which, due to a vast assortment of collaborators and samples, exceeds that of the self-titled album.) Lemonade can also be heard as the dark flipside of Beyoncé. When "Dishes smashed on the counter" is bleakly observed, just before "Pictures snatched out the frame/Bitch, I scratched out your name and face" is delivered with seething wrath, it's hard to not flash back to "Drunk in Love," in which the presumably same couple were revelrous in the same room. After the first three-quarters play out in compelling if somewhat erratic fashion, Lemonade closes with a torrid stretch. "Freedom" is a marching anthem of resilience and preservation, produced by Just Blaze with a glowing guest verse from Kendrick Lamar. The loved-up "All Night" is a tangle of emotions and hints at reconciliation, facilitated by the horns from OutKast's "SpottieOttieDopaliscious." And then, at last, there's the strutting "Formation," simultaneously a tack-on and an ideal finale, where Beyoncé delights in her blackness, femininity, and Southern origin with supreme wordplay.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	18	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:00:00.757794	1

It's a gimmick, of course -- a flimsy one. Revealed through interviews in 2005, Sasha was said to be Beyoncé's "stage persona," an embodiment of the outgoing, aggressive, on-stage Beyoncé that doesn't necessarily represent the real Beyoncé. Sasha now has a last name (possibly picked up from Tyra Banks, who maybe took a cue from Klymaxx), and is granted half an album (the second disc) to express herself. These five songs, when compared to the majority of B'day, are actually less fun, less impulsive, and yes, less fierce. "Diva," a variation on Lil Wayne's "A Milli," is the only track that could go toe to toe with the likes of B'day's "Freakum Dress" or "Ring the Alarm," at least in terms of audacity. At the other end is "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)," a dire "Get Me Bodied" retread. Otherwise, the Sasha Fierce half is full of decent, if easily forgettable, upbeat pop. If placed within the context of an album without a packaging ploy, there'd be little evidence that Beyoncé is making a radical progression or being any more bold than before. It would, if anything, be notable as the least R&B-oriented batch of songs she has made -- that is, if it wasn't for the I Am half, essentially a small set of adult contemporary ballads. Acoustic guitars, pianos, strings, contemplative soul searching, and grand sweeping gestures fill it out, with more roots in '70s soft rock than soul. Beyoncé feels each line to the fullest extent, which almost rescues the set's staidness. "If I Were a Boy," while sounding like the watery backdrop for a singing competition finale, turns out to be the album's standout, both for its lyrics and Beyoncé's tormented performance. It could have been the song that broke an unfairly neglected adult-R&B singer like Heather Headley into the mainstream, and don't be surprised if a country artist nabs a CMA Award by covering it.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	20	CD	2026-01-18 22:00:00.757795	2

A Houston native and rodeo fan, Beyoncé released the unmistakably countrified "Daddy Lessons" on 2016's Lemonade then upped the ante with a Chicks remix that was met with industry backlash. But no one puts Beyoncé in a corner, and Cowboy Carter is her gracious "told ya so" moment. First single "Texas Hold 'Em" saw her become the first Black woman to top Billboard's Hot 100 Country chart, and that's even after some country radio stations refused to play it. That song is a joy: echoing the Chicks' and Shania's C&W pop, but also Rhiannon Giddens' mountain folk (that's her playing banjo on the song) as well as all-American sweet soul music. The excellent Raphael Saadiq is a co-writer, and his touch shows. And damned if the affecting ballad "16 Carriages"—grand in the "Halo" and "If I Were a Boy" tradition—doesn't sound like an autobiographical recounting of Beyoncé's career start as a teen. "At fifteen, the innocence was gone astray/ Had to take care of home at an early age/ I saw Mama cryin', I saw Daddy lyin'/ Had to sacrifice and leave my fears behind," she sings, chillingly, against steel guitar and crackling percussion. © Shelly Ridenour/Qobuz	31	CD	2026-01-18 22:00:00.757795	2

The lead single, the late-'70s-funk-inspired "Deja Vu," had the audacity to not be as monstrous as "Crazy in Love" -- its stay at the top of the charts was relatively brief, so clearly there was evidence of some drop-off there. This was quickly followed by "Ring the Alarm," an angered, atonal, and out-of-character song with an accompanying video that invited all kinds of perplexed analysis, along with debate on whether Beyoncé was being autobiographical or, as the singer claimed, channeling her Dreamgirls character. All of this gave the haters plenty of ammo when anything less than 100 percent polite, ladylike, and expected was bound to do the trick. Add to this an album title that can be pronounced just like "bidet," along with the advertisement that the album's ten songs were whipped up in two weeks, and you have yourself a career-killing train wreck. B'day isn't even close to that. While Beyoncé does sound like she's in a bit of a hurry throughout the album, and there are no songs with the smooth elegance of "Me, Myself and I" or "Be with You," it is lean in a beneficial way, propelled by just as many highlights as the overlong Dangerously in Love. Two collaborations with Rich Harrison swagger and preen: "Been locked up in the house way too long/It's time to get it, 'cause once again he's out doing wrong" (the blaring/marching "Freakum Dress"); "Don't give me no lip, let mama do it all" (the spectacularly layered "Suga Mama"). The Neptunes assist on "Green Light," an ambitious, fleet-footed number that continually switches tempos and sounds, as well as "Kitty Kat," a deceptively sweet, rainbow-colored track -- where what sounds like purrs are more like claws-out dismissals -- that could've been pulled from one of the first three Kelis albums. And even with an entirely bonkers line like "I can do for you what Martin did for the people," "Upgrade U" is the most potent track on the album, a low-slung Cameron Wallace production where Beyoncé wears and buys the pants while making her proposition sound more like empowerment than emasculation. If the circus surrounding this whole thing -- which could take up to ten pages to document -- was an elaborate ploy to transform Beyoncé into an underdog, there really is some kind of genius at play, but it's extremely unlikely that anyone in her camp could've predicted that the expectations and reactions would be less rational than any of Beyoncé's decisions and actions. There is nothing desperate or weak about this album.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	30	CD	2026-01-18 22:00:00.757796	2

Queen B surprised us with the release of a live album taken from her two dazzling concerts at Coachella in 2018, chronicled by a Netflix documentary. B performs a retrospective, revisiting 40 tracks from her 22-year career. There are no new songs here, but there is a studio cover with Tay Keith of Before I Let Go, the Frankie Beverly and Maze 1981 soul track. Other Destiny’s Child members Michelle Williams and Kelly Rowland make bonus appearances on Lose My Breath, Say My Name and Soldier, husband Jay-Z on Déjà Vu, sister Solange on Get Me Bodied, and her daughter sings Afro-American anthem Sing and Lift Every Voice. This performance effectively explains why it was nicknamed ‘Beychella’, as this makes its mark on the festival’s history. And that was the goal, with 200 people on stage, colossal high-budget visual spectacle in this immense two-hour performance highlighting afro-feminist empowerment; Beyoncé has earnt her throne. “When I decided to do Coachella, instead of me pulling out my flower crown, it was more important that I brought our culture to Coachella.” To the sound of the second lines of a New Orleans brass band, a revamped drumline, Malcolm X on Don’t Hurt Yourself and amidst multiple references to African-American history, the queen of pop inhabiting the Queen Nefertiti reminds us of the importance of her discography in the 3rd millennium. © Charlotte Saintoin/Qobuz	35	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:00:00.757796	1

Not to be confused with the reimagined score/soundtrack featuring Hans Zimmer, Tim Rice, Lebo M., Elton John, and Beyoncé herself, The Gift recruits a roster of African talent and American hip-hop/R&B acts to create a buoyant hybrid of futuristic, cross-Atlantic Afro-pop. Like a similar big-screen epic about a regal feline, this expertly curated collection is an artistic showcase celebrating Africa and black musical traditions, elevating the movie experience with strategic thematic interludes that could help this album endure far longer than the film. Also, like Kendrick Lamar did with Black Panther, Beyoncé is careful not to overshadow the burgeoning talents on display here, inserting herself when appropriate and evenly distributing her own songs throughout the set's expansive track list. Representing Nigeria, Tekno, Yemi Alade, and Mr Eazi form a formidable trio on the menacing highlight "Don't Jealous Me," while Burna Boy delivers a smooth "Ja Ara E." Later, Tiwa Savage teams with Eazi on the fun "Keys to the Kingdom," and Wizkid joins Guyanese rapper Saint Jhn, Beyoncé, and her daughter Blue Ivy Carter on the wholesome, empowering "Brown Skin Girl." Ghanaian reggae artist Shatta Wale collides with Major Lazer's trademark dancehall-pop on the thumping "Already." Meanwhile, a team of South African artists contributes to another standout, the explosive "My Power." Along with rising American rapper Tierra Whack, Nija, and Beyoncé, Busiswa and Moonchild Sanelly deliver verses in Zulu and isiXhosa, hailing the coming king with an undeniable blend of defiance and fierce pride. Even the relative downer "Scar" -- a dramatic denouement told from the titular villain's perspective -- captures the imagination and attention, due to the dedicated performances of North American singer/rappers 070 Shake and Jessie Reyez. These collaborations are effortless in their execution, making The Gift feel more like a joyous party or family affair rather than a Beyoncé vanity project. On her end, Beyoncé does deliver a handful of showstoppers, including the inspirational de facto opener "Bigger," where she connects real-world themes of family, parenthood, and birthright, singing not only to Simba, but her own children, and "Find Your Way Back (Circle of Life)," another buoyant lesson of empowerment. "Mood 4 Eva" is a classic Beyoncé anthem featuring partner Jay-Z, film co-star Donald Glover, and enough quotable lyrics to emblazon an entire store's worth of T-shirts. As with the official score/soundtrack, The Gift closes with the unbearably uplifting "Spirit," a shiver-inducing anthem packed with enough power to inspire anyone to seize their destiny atop their own personal Pride Rock. On The Lion King: The Gift, Beyoncé deftly connects a kid's flick to something bigger, honoring not only Africa and its traditions but also shifting perspective to future destiny and greatness. It's a superior statement and a lesson on how to properly execute a winning soundtrack.© Neil Z. Yeung /TiVo	34	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:00:00.757797	1

Two collaborations with Rich Harrison swagger and preen: "Been locked up in the house way too long/It's time to get it, 'cause once again he's out doing wrong" (the blaring/marching "Freakum Dress"); "Don't give me no lip, let mama do it all" (the spectacularly layered "Suga Mama"). The Neptunes assist on "Green Light," an ambitious, fleet-footed number that continually switches tempos and sounds, as well as "Kitty Kat," a deceptively sweet, rainbow-colored track -- where what sounds like purrs are more like claws-out dismissals -- that could've been pulled from one of the first three Kelis albums. And even with an entirely bonkers line like "I can do for you what Martin did for the people," "Upgrade U" is the most potent track on the album, a low-slung Cameron Wallace production where Beyoncé wears and buys the pants while making her proposition sound more like empowerment than emasculation. If the circus surrounding this whole thing -- which could take up to ten pages to document -- was an elaborate ploy to transform Beyoncé into an underdog, there really is some kind of genius at play, but it's extremely unlikely that anyone in her camp could've predicted that the expectations and reactions would be less rational than any of Beyoncé's decisions and actions. There is nothing desperate or weak about this album.© Andy Kellman /TiVo	24	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:00:00.757798	1

To complain that True Blue is calculated is to not get Madonna -- that's a large part of what she does, and she is exceptional at it, but she also makes fine music. What's brilliant about True Blue is that she does both here, using the music to hook in critics just as she's baiting a mass audience with such masterstrokes as "Papa Don't Preach," where she defiantly states she's keeping her baby. Her real trick here, however, is transcending her status as a dance-pop diva by consciously recalling classic girl group pop ("True Blue," "Jimmy Jimmy") to snag the critics, while deepening the dance grooves ("Open Your Heart," "Where's the Party"), touching on Latin rhythms ("La Isla Bonita"), making a plea for world peace ("Love Makes the World Go Round"), and delivering a tremendous ballad that rewrites the rules of adult contemporary crossover ("Live to Tell"). It's even harder to have the entire album play as an organic, cohesive work. Certainly, there's some calculation behind the entire thing, but what matters is the end result, one of the great dance-pop albums, a record that demonstrates Madonna's true skills as a songwriter, record-maker, provocateur, and entertainer through its wide reach, accomplishment, and sheer sense of fun.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	31	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:00:03.631059	1
133593	Finally Enough Love: 50 Number Ones	Madonna	44.58	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/bb/px/tu514gw6zpxbb_600.jpg	qobuz:156519666|tu514gw6zpxbb	The title Finally Enough Love: 50 Number Ones is slightly misleading, suggesting that Madonna topped the pop charts 50 times. The 50 Number Ones in the title of Finally Enough Love refer to the hits Madonna placed at the top of Billboard's dance charts, a chart she called home even longer than the pop charts themselves. The last time Madonna placed in the Billboard Top Ten was in 2012, when "Give Me All Your Luvin" peaked at ten, but she remained a dominant presence on the Dance charts into the 2020s, when "I Don't Search I Find" -- a single that lends this compilation its title phrase -- reached number one in 2020. Truth be told, Madonna had more than 50 dance chart-toppers -- "Causing a Commotion" is notable among the absences -- but it's difficult to find fault with a compilation this generous, particularly when it offers such revelations as well. Positioning Madonna as a dance artist helps emphasize her innovations while suggesting she remained a vital part of dance culture for decades. Viewing her through this prism naturally downplays her pop sensibilities and gift for sultry ballads, yet it still comes as a shock that the '80s hits are wrapped up in nine songs, while the '90s are concluded at the collection's 22nd track with "Beautiful Stranger." This means well over half of the collection is devoted to the 21st century, a period when Madonna was a superstar yet only occasionally in center stage. Effectively, this is the photo negative of Celebration, the 2009 album that contains all the pop radio staples: where that largely played for comfort, this is percolating and alive, with even the biggest hits being offered in alternate single or video edits or different mixes. The result is a compilation that pushes Madonna's artistry to the forefront, as it shows a musician who continually engages with fashions, trends, and innovations. Certainly, this doesn't tell the entirety of Madonna's story, but it's a crucial chapter to document and, fortunately, it's done so quite thoroughly here.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	32	CD	2026-01-18 22:00:15.814062	2

Unlike other veteran artists who attempted to come to terms with electronica, Madonna was always a dance artist, so it's no real shock to hear her sing over breakbeats, pulsating electronics, and blunted trip-hop beats. Still, it's mildly surprising that it works as well as it does, largely due to Madonna and Orbit's subtle attack. They've reined in the beats, tamed electronica's eccentricities, and retained her flair for pop melodies, creating the first mainstream pop album that successfully embraces techno. Sonically, it's the most adventurous record she has made, but it's far from inaccessible, since the textures are alluring and the songs have a strong melodic foundation, whether it's the swirling title track, the meditative opener, "Substitute for Love," or the ballad "Frozen." For all of its attributes, there's a certain distance to Ray of Light, born of the carefully constructed productions and Madonna's newly mannered, technically precise singing. It all results in her most mature and restrained album, which is an easy achievement to admire, yet not necessarily an easy one to love.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	19	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:00:15.814065	1

Even though it is apparent that she is trying to make a "serious" album, the kaleidoscopic variety of pop styles on Like a Prayer is quite dazzling. Ranging from the deep funk of "Express Yourself" and "Keep It Together" to the haunting "Oh Father" and "Like a Prayer," Madonna displays a commanding sense of songcraft, making this her best and most consistent album.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	9	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:00:15.814066	1

After all, it features 17 of Madonna's greatest hits, from "Holiday" and "Like a Virgin" to "Like a Prayer" and "Vogue." However, looks can be deceiving. It's true that The Immaculate Collection contains the bulk of Madonna's hits, but there are several big hits that aren't present, including "Angel," "Dress You Up," "True Blue," "Who's That Girl," and "Causing a Commotion." The songs that are included are frequently altered. Everything on the collection is remastered in Q-sound, which gives an exaggerated sense of stereo separation that often distorts the original intent of the recordings. Furthermore, several songs are faster than their original versions and some are faded out earlier than either their single or album versions, while others are segued together. In other words, while all the hits are present, they're simply not in their correct versions. Nevertheless, The Immaculate Collection remains a necessary purchase, because it captures everything Madonna is about and it proves that she was one of the finest singles artists of the '80s. Until the original single versions are compiled on another album, The Immaculate Collection is the closest thing to a definitive retrospective.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	34	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:00:15.814066	1

The singer explored themes as varied as fame (Drowned World / Substitute For Love), motherhood (Nothing Really Matters, Little Star), and her new spiritual path (Shanti/Ashtangi, Frozen). Produced in part by William Orbit, the album was originally intended to be accompanied by a remix EP. Ultimately shelved, Veronica Electronica is resurfacing in 2025.The tracklist includes the Austrian DJ Peter Rauhofer’s remix of Nothing Really Matters (he passed away in 2013) and Victor Calderone’s reimagining of Sky Fits Heaven. Naturally, Ray of Light also gets the remix treatment courtesy of British DJ Sasha. As for Frozen, William Orbit takes to the decks himself, and the original track’s spiritual dimension climbs to new heights. The Power of Good-Bye and Skin also make the cut. Veronica Electronica (Veronica being Madonna’s confirmation name) closes with Gone Gone Gone, an unreleased track that didn’t make it onto the original album. Madonna handled the production herself alongside Rick Nowels, known for crafting hits for Belinda Carlisle, Santana, and Céline Dion. © Nicolas Magenham/Qobuz	26	CD	2026-01-18 22:00:15.814067	2

Surrounded by a new generation of producers (Nellee Hooper, Dallas Austin and Babyface), she leaned into a more muted, R&B-rooted sound. Less provocative and more intimate than her previous projects, Bedtime Stories foreshadowed the more radical electronic explorations she would dive into a few years later.Created to celebrate the album’s 30th anniversary, this EP delivers a handful of demos from the early recording sessions—some from tracks that made the final cut (“Don’t Stop”), and others that did not (“Love Won’t Wait”, which wouldn’t have felt out of place on a Mariah Carey record). Also included is the demo of “Right On Time”, which is driven by a tight groove. This ‘Untold Chapter’ is rounded out with four remixed versions of key tracks: “Secret”, “Freedom”, “Human Nature”, and “Let Down Your Guard”.Restored and meticulously remastered from the original Warner Records tapes, the tracks on this EP illuminate a pivotal moment in Madonna’s artistic evolution in the mid-1990s. © Nicolas Magenham/Qobuz	12	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:00:15.814067	1

Daniel Darc's former colleague from Taxi Girl had already worked on several projects, such as the albums Music in 2000 and American Life in 2003. His role here is to take the delirious musical experimentation to new extremes, all the while keeping in line with Madonna's melodic pop style. The most obvious example of Mirwais’ musical madness is Dark Ballet, a song inspired by Joan of Arc that features a long synthetic-baroque arrangement à la Wendy Carlos as well as a mischievous monologue by Madonna that’s told from the point of view of the Maid of Orléans. Maintaining a style that’s both playful and totally insane, the lively disco strings on God Control are a real highlight. Madonna is also politically engaged in this work, focusing on the failed gun control in America (with a sample from Emma Gonzales’ speech in I Rise) as well as speaking out for minorities (particularly in the postmodern fado Killers Who Are Partying). Speaking of fado, Lusophone culture is one of the album’s main themes – probably due to Madonna’s decision to move to Portugal in 2017. On Batuka she celebrates Cape Verde (the batuque being a kind of Cape Verdean music characterised by a call and response structure). Madonna also pays tribute to Colombia with the reggaeton singer Maluma, with whom she sings (and flirts) on two duets: Medellin and Bitch I'm Loca. Finally, she also mentions Picasso's Spain on I Don't Search I Find (quoted from the painter). The album highlights the malleable aspect of her voice (be it auto-tuned, whispered or spoken) and throughout the work Madonna always strikes a perfect balance between the gravity of political commitment on the one hand and the lightness of the duets and Mirwais’ production on the other. She does complete justice album’s title, Madame X most likely being a reference to Marlene Dietrich from Agent X 27, Joseph Von Sternberg's 1931 biopic of the spy Mata Hari. “Madame X is a secret agent, travelling around the world, changing identities and fighting for freedom. She brings light to dark places,” explained the singer in a teaser video for her project. It’s a masked, playful, freedom-fighting and confident Madonna that we find here as she enters her seventh decade. © Nicolas Magenham/Qobuz	38	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:00:15.814068	1

After Cardi B took her under her wing signing her to 200 Entertainment, she released her critically acclaimed album Fever in 2019, then the hits Diamond and WAP in 2020 which opened the way for a real coup de force: this album Good News. Hers is an exemplary, flawless trajectory, well marketed and thought out.  But true talents rarely faulter. With such a fluid rise to fame, we wouldn’t be surprised if Good News, a collection of inevitable future hits, turns out to be a Grammy-winning album. Its raw, trap aspects and slapping TR-808 instrumentals (Do It on the Tip, Movie) make for a satisfying outlet interspersed with a variety of different ideas. An almost disco-funk sound can be heard on Don’t Rock Me to Sleep as well as impeccable rapping on top of high-pitched soul samples on Circles (which samples Jazmine Sullivan’s Holding You Down), and industrial elements on Don’t Stop featuring the unmissable Young Thug… There is also something profoundly retro about this album, especially in the very 2000-sounding instrumentals as heard on Sugar Baby. Raw electronic sounds are plentiful and humanize the phenomenal Megan Thee Stallion and her unstoppable rise. © Brice Miclet/Qobuz	13	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:00:20.420717	1

She became one of the most successful female rappers in the world, thanks in part to her hit single WAP featuring Cardi B. But let's be clear: while she has made some forays into pop, she has not turned into a diva. This new mixtape, Something For Thee Hotties, proves it. With its direct, ultra synthetic trap sound, it is in the tradition of the genre, notably thanks to the omnipresence of the legendary beatmaker Juicy J. TR-808's beats rage, the production is refined, and the rap is full-throated. Megan Thee Stallion goes straight to the point and won’t be seduced by current musical trends, to the point that she embraces a purist style.

But Carter is a genuine superstar, performing at the Grammys alongside more decipherable A-listers like the Weeknd and the currently unbeatable Kendrick Lamar, who features here. And not only that; to a huge swath of young rap fans in the 2020s, Carti is the voice of their generation, the pioneer of rage-rap. His influence is felt in many quarters, but especially cross-sections of DIY artists applying liberal smears of distortion to their sound—and their extremely online fans.Depending on where you're standing, it's either a surprise or completely inevitable that Carti's long-awaited third album (fourth to those of us who consider 2017's self-titled debut "mixtape" his best) is his most conventional. It's a throwback "event" record of 30 songs in 76 minutes rather than his acolytes' usual blur of TikTok-sized nuggets. Music is full of top-shelf guests and sonics from every stage of his career: incredible opener "POP OUT" screeches like a dentist drill compared to even the noisiest tracks on Whole Lotta Red but it's followed by a Kanye-esque gospel choir on "CRUSH." There's also a strong Ye influence in the choppy soul sample of the beautiful "BACKD00R," on which Kendrick drops by just to sing, while "RADAR" jumps back in time to prime Lex Luger circa 2010. Carti's own dead-on Future impression tag-teams with the real Future all over the place.Music's spectrum is completely summarized when Carti follows the jammed-circuit noise of "COCAINE NOSE" with an outlier on the opposite end, the soulful "WE ALL NEED DA VIBES," which betrays no hint of the curator or guest Young Thug's known weirdness. It's fitting that the cover declares "I Am Music," because Carti is like a sentient conduit of event-rap itself—distorting through a semi-blown speaker, of course. © Daniel Aaron/Qobuz	31	CD	2026-01-18 22:00:47.049421	2

This effort, which appeared in the twilight of 2020, just when it was least expected, could wake the dead with its great billows of saturated trap and penetrating bass, and it closed out the year beautifully. All the Atlanta sound is here, condensed into twenty-four tracks, from codeine odes such as Sky or Teen X (featuring the ubiquitous Future), to cries of wild monsters, sometimes so deafening that you might imagine yourself in hell, like on King Vamp, F1lthy, or the unstoppable No Sl33p. "When I go to sleep I dream about murder", he intones on this last, as if to remind us that monsters not only populate this album, but also the streets Playboi Carti ran during his adolescence. As executive producer of the album, we find Kanye West, also a guest on the track Go2DaMoon, which introduces an absolutely monstrous banger called Stop Breathing. Whole Lotta Red is a masterclass in contrasts. Because despite the unity of the productions based on the TR-808, Playboi Carti masters everything: the slow groove of New N3on (a huge favourite from producer Maaly Raw), the bass that drives the crazy Punk Monk, the most melodic productions from beatmaker Art Dealer, or the sensitivity of F33l Lik3 Dyin, which closes this fantastic album. So the rumors were true: Atlanta is indeed home to the one and only vampire of rap. © Brice Miclet/Qobuz	33	CD	2026-01-18 22:00:47.049426	2

With a mixtape and above all his track “Magnolia”, he proved his early fans right, inventing a completely minimalist style by associating with a visionary and atypical producer, Pi’erre Bourne.For this first studio album, released unexpectedly, Playboi Carti and Pi’erre Bourne state on 19 tracks all the ideas suggested in “Magnolia”. A science of texture and sound research is combined to perfect placement, sometimes repeated on loop for entire measures. By stripping down rap to its purest form, the duo engraves their creation as almost concrete electronic music, disorienting the audience in the middle of a maze of syllables and small synthetic sounds. Sometimes surrealist or just from daily life, Playboi Carti’s sentences seem to float in time and space, offering in the course of the tracks a permanent dizziness, a unique experience in current rap. Even the guests like Travis Scott, Nicki Minaj or Chief Keef are broken down in this molecular cuisine in which each atom is multiplied to get the essence of it.With Die Lit, Playboi Carti’s music has become inseparable from Pi’erre Bourne’s work. It is thus an invitation to extreme dance, an almost sensory trip, a new way of thinking for rap music in 2018. © Aurélien Chapuis/Qobuz	19	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:00:58.519289	1
473703	MUSIC - SORRY 4 DA WAIT	Playboi Carti	69.41	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/0a/u6/g9za3ugimu60a_600.jpg	qobuz:326486639|g9za3ugimu60a	It comes as no surprise that Playboi Carti's third studio album, Music, is overwhelming. The often-imitated, record-breakingly popular rapper built his empire on a style that overwhelms and disorients, from his head-spinning, distortion-saturated production to his baby cyborg flows to lyrics that feel transmitted from the future. Arriving five years after the dungeonous shoegaze trap of 2020's Whole Lotta Red, Music (also known as I Am Music) attempts to make up for lost time with 30 tracks, all full of ideas in various states of completion. The more fully formed moments hit their respective marks. "Pop Out" is a demented rage track with a beat that sounds like it's breaking for the song's entire duration, and the flame-broiled hooks of "Cocaine Nose" are similarly exciting, similarly blown out. The Lil Uzi Vert-assisted "Twin Trim" is featherweight trap-pop heavy on synths and melodic flows, and "Like Weezy" is similar, taking notes from 2010s radio rap production but ultimately landing somewhere stranger and less accessible than any Lil Wayne hit. "Crush," one of several songs to feature Travis Scott, aims for the opulence of peak Kanye, with backing from a choir evoking the same masterwork aspirations of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, only delivered with Donda II levels of inspiration. Carti uses Music to try on different identities, switching gears as often as he invites other top-tier rappers into the booth. "We Need All Da Vibes" features Ty Dolla $ign and Young Thug on its smooth, summery instrumental, resulting in a tune that exists in an almost entirely different world than the tripped-out trap of "Charge Dem Hoes a Fee" (featuring Future and Travis Scott) or the red-lined space invaders trap of "Toxic" (with Skepta). Kendrick Lamar provides ad-libs for a few songs and contributes a verse to the anxious banger "Good Credit," and Carti somewhat reprises the energy of his appearance on "Timeless" (a highlight from the Weeknd's 2025 album Hurry Up Tomorrow), bringing in the Weeknd to sing a melancholic hook for one of Music's more atmospheric pop moments. Music never feels quite cohesive enough to register as an album, and its bloated, style-hopping track list and 76-minute run time don't help any consistent themes to solidify. At the same time, the album lacks the kind of casual ease that would make it come off like a mixtape or a nonchalant dump of every partially cooked idea Carti has had in the last half-decade. Instead, Music is a cyclone of weird turns, big ideas, and choices that don't really make sense together, but are still somehow enjoyable under the banner of blissful confusion that Playboi Carti has made his brand from the start.© Fred Thomas /TiVo	6	CD	2026-01-18 22:00:58.51929	2

Positioning herself directly between urban R&B with tracks like "Fantasy," and adult contemporary with songs like "One Sweet Day," a duet with Boyz II Men, Carey appeals to both audiences equally because of the sheer amount of craft and hard work she puts into her albums. Daydream is her best record to date, featuring a consistently strong selection of songs and a remarkably impassioned performance by Carey. A few of the songs are second-rate -- particularly the cover of Journey's "Open Arms" -- but Daydream demonstrates that Carey continues to perfect her craft and that she has earned her status as an R&B/pop diva.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	20	CD	2026-01-18 22:01:14.801322	2

And then she spoke the pièce de résistance: "He's [in] a hand-holding club." Whether or not Carey and .Paak are indeed in more than a "hand-holding club," Bruno Mars' Silk Sonic collaborator has his sonic fingerprints all over her 16th album, one of her best in years.The anachronistic, '80s version of neo soul favored by the drumming/singing/rapping polymath is instantly recognizable from the opening moments of the audacious "Mi," which also shares Silk Sonic's under-the-breath injections of humor. When Carey sings how you couldn't walk a mile in her shoes, she quickly ad libs "'cause they hurt like hell." That's followed by the actual .Paak collab, "Play This Song," which pulls out the usual Blue Magic/Delfonics stops with glockenspiel and sitar decorating the retro production gloss. Carey has rarely had an opening one-two so fluttering and gorgeous. It sets up the old-school rap-flavored single, "Type Dangerous" as a tempo-shifting palate cleanser rather than a reason to lean on every word, and "Sugar Sweet," a more contemporary-sounding cut featuring Shenseea and Kehlani.But it's the '70s and '80s soul pastiches on Here For It All that make for some of Carey's finest work in ages on her first full-length in seven years. The Smokey Robinson doo-wop of "In Your Feelings" and the inspirational, "Save the Best for Last"-esque "Nothing Is Impossible" are some of the most impressive and mature tunes in her oeuvre. And lest you think Carey is holding back or incapable at 56, she finishes off the easy-funking Babyface-style lope of the title closer with overdubs of her famous whistle register. © Daniel Aaron/Qobuz	12	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:01:14.801328	1

She shifts through styles, offering fans from all musical camps a gift of their own. There is even a "Joy to the World" medley mixing the old and the new: the traditional Christmas song and the Three Dog Night hit. And, as usual, her gospel-voiced background singers are out in full force. There are two ways to enjoy this album. One is to sit back and revel in Carey's vocal fireworks, and the other is to pour yourself a glass of eggnog, get cozy by the tree, and have yourself a Merry Christmas.© TiVo	28	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:01:14.801328	1

The same mix of dance/R&B/ballads that gave Carey's debut such tremendous auditory appeal can be found with equal strength on this release, indicating that placing firm belief in the notion of "Why fool with success?" may, in fact, have its merits. Most notably, the gospel influences of "If It's Over" (with music co-written by Carole King), the yearning cries for a lost love in "Can't Let Go," and the catchy, upbeat title track all serve to send the listener on a musical journey filled with varying emotions. However, the one emotion that prevails upon completion of the album is definitely a positive one: satisfaction.© Ashley S. Battel /TiVo	23	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:01:14.801329	1

Unlike many of those big-budget albums, including several made by Mariah herself, Memoirs isn't the product of a stable of producers and collaborators; it is almost entirely the work of The-Dream and Tricky Stewart, the team best known for their tracks for Rihanna. Certainly, there are echoes of "Umbrella" to be heard on Memoirs, just as there are elements of the gauzy "Touch My Body," The-Dream and Tricky Stewart's previous single for Mariah, although working with mainly one set of producers does give Memoirs a cohesion that can sometimes lapse into sameness, but not in an unpleasant fashion. Even if it doesn't smack of the confessional autobiography of the title, there's no denying that Memoirs is an album, not a collection of tracks, possessing its own flow and mood, which gives it a personality the slightly desperate E=MC2 lacked, even if it never manages to kick out a song that is all that distinctive on its own terms. Nevertheless, what it also lacks is the pandering, heavy-handed sexuality Mariah has relied upon too heavily this decade -- and in doing so, it feels age appropriate in a way she hasn't in a long time, despite a collection of silly, jumbled lyrics. All Memoirs needs to push it over the edge is a great pair of singles, and their absence does hurt the album a bit, but not enough to prevent it from being her most interesting album in a decade.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	18	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:01:14.80133	1

Carey convincingly seizes many opportunities to display her incredible vocal range on such memorable tracks as the popular "Vision of Love" (featured during her television debut on The Arsenio Hall Show, an appearance noted by many as her formal introduction to stardom), the energetic "Someday," and the moody sounds of the hidden treasure "Vanishing." With this collection of songs acting as a springboard for future successes, Carey establishes a strong standard of comparison for other breakthrough artists of this genre.© Ashley S.

Nothing will age your catalog like leaving your record label, however, so when she flew the Columbia coop for Virgin in 2000, her old label assembled Greatest Hits for release a couple months after the monumental disaster of Glitter, her Virgin debut. Now, this move was surely designed to further wound the ailing Mariah, but this kind of collection was essentially inevitable, and it's about as good as it could be, containing all of her big hits (including songs that did not make it to the top of the charts) over the course of 28 tracks. This is certainly helpful, since it rounds up everything, but its double-disc running time is a bit of a detriment, since it simply is too much. By the end of the second disc, the collection feels a little padded, and her music simply sounds better in the more concentrated collection of #1's, since it runs smoother and has all the really big hits (with the notable exception of the original version of her best single, "Fantasy"). But if you want more simply for archival reasons, this will suit the bill (even though the packaging is unbearably skimpy: no notes, just publishing information and thumbnails of the single covers, which is like having no packaging at all).© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	37	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:01:14.801331	1
235047	The Emancipation of Mimi	Mariah Carey	64.59	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/ib/b2/qr6scn5eub2ib_600.jpg	qobuz:54911750|qr6scn5eub2ib	The titular "Mimi" of The Emancipation of Mimi is, by all accounts, an alter ego of Mariah, a persona that captures Carey's true feelings and emotions. In case you didn't know what "emancipation" means, Mariah helpfully provides a dictionary definition of the word in the opening pages of the liner notes for her eighth proper album: it means "to free from restraint, control, oppression, or the power of another" or "to free from any controlling influence" or "to free somebody from restrictions or conventions." So, on The Emancipation of Mimi, Mariah frees herself from the constraints of being herself, revealing herself to be -- well, somebody that looks startlingly like Beyoncé, if the cover art is any indication. Mimi, or at least the sound of her emancipation, sounds remarkably like Beyoncé, too, working a similarly sultry, low-key, polished club groove. And that's the main story of The Emancipation of Mimi: since the reserved, tasteful adult contemporary pop of 2002's Charmbracelet failed to revive her career, she's done a 180 and returned to R&B, in hopes that maybe this will create some excitement. It's not a bad idea, particularly because Mariah could use any change at this point, and it's not executed all that badly either, as all 14 tracks -- heavy on mid-tempo cuts and big ballads, with a few harder dance tunes featuring big-name guest rappers scattered along the way -- all follow the same deliberately smoky, late-night template. While the Neptunes provide the best dance cut here with "Say Somethin'" (featuring a cameo by Snoop Dogg), especially welcome are some nice old-school '70s smooth soul flourishes, best heard on James Poyser's deliciously sleek "Mine Again" and such "Big Jim" Wright productions as "I Wish You Knew" and "Fly Like a Bird." As good as those Wright-helmed cuts are, they are also the times that the mixes slip and don't hide the flaws in Mariah's voice, and it sounds as airy, thin, and damaged as it did on Charmbracelet, where her ragged vocals dealt a fatal blow to an already weak album. Here, apart from those Wright tracks, the producers camouflage her voice in a number of ways, usually involving putting the groove and the sound of the production in front of the vocals. While the tunes aren't always memorable, it does make for a consistent album, one that's head and shoulders above the other LPs she's released in the 2000s, even if it doesn't compare with her glory days of the '90s. Ironically enough, a big reason why The Emancipation of Mimi doesn't sound as good as those '90s albums is that Mariah never sounds like herself on this record. When she's not sounding like Beyoncé, she sounds desperate to be part of the waning bling era, dropping product placements for Bacardi, Calgon, and Louis Vuitton, or bragging about her house in Capri and her own G4, all of which sounds a little tired and awkward coming from a 35-year-old woman in her 15th year of superstardom. Disregarding these two rather sizeable problems, The Emancipation of Mimi still works, at least as a slick, highly crafted piece of dance-pop -- it might not be as hip as it thinks it is, nor is it as catchy as it should be, but it's smooth and listenable, which is enough to have it qualify as a relative comeback for "Mimi" Carey.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	33	CD	2026-01-18 22:01:14.801331	2

It took almost six months and a Grammy performance the following year for the world to come face to face with the Mariah Carey phenomenon and for her record to go to number 1. Since then she’s sold the most albums of the 90s, become a global star and produced fifteen studio albums. To celebrate thirty years of success, the pop diva has brought out an autobiography and this compilation album – The Rarities. The first track-list is made up of unreleased tracks, remixes and B sides which were never released to the public. Some songs, like Here We Go Around Again (1990) and I Pray (2005), weren’t included in the singer’s biggest albums for reasons that remain unknown. The most interesting thing about this compilation album is the glimpse it offers into the huge amount of material produced during her golden years. Songs like the synth-filled B side Do You Think Of Me (1993) and the RnB-esque Slipping Away (1996) sit alongside covers of previously released tracks. Close My Eyes, from the 1997 album Butterfly, allows you to see how the singer’s voice has changed over time as does the album’s single – Save The Day, featuring Lauryn Hill – which was recorded in 2011. The second part of The Rarities is a live performance recorded at the Tokyo Dome in 1996. And it’s a masterpiece. This release is not the sensationalist box set one might have expected. It is a real work of art that gives a fresh perspective on one of pop’s most important singers. © Brice Miclet/Qobuz	13	CD	2026-01-18 22:01:14.801331	2

Throughout this performance, recorded live for MTV's Unplugged, Carey is quite electric and charismatic within her vocal presence and succeeds in enlightening the already engaged audience from the get-go. The audience certainly feels the warmth and sincerity of Carey's lyrical messages of longing, loss, friendships, and love. Carey's supporting cast of gifted group musicians back her up with soulful melodiousness, spontaneity, and enriching percussion. Gradually, the power and esteem of these tales lift to new heights and remain at a peak with the breathtaking, moment-making performance of "I'll Be There," a charming song first cut by the Jackson 5. All and all, this is an inspiring event, though still simple enough for the listener to catch those musical places that need to be polished. "Can't Let Go," Carey's radio single for the album, makes it as the seventh and final track, though the cameras are shut off for the Unplugged episode. Certainly, this is a record of hope, virtue, and the possibilities of newfound love.© Shawn M. Haney /TiVo	18	Vinyl	2026-01-18 22:01:14.801332	1

After all, all the elements are in place -- the crossover dance hits, the ballads, the cameos, the hip producers, the weird cover choice from the early '80s. But dig a little deeper, and her words ring true. Rainbow is the first Carey album where she's written personal lyrics, and allusions to her separation from Mottola are evident throughout the album, even if it doesn't really amount to the "story" she mentions in the liner notes. As appropriate for any introspective album, it's a bit ballad-heavy, which makes Rainbow seem a little samey. Yet that's not the only reason the record has a weird sense of déjà vu, since this follows the same formula as its two predecessors, distinguished primarily by her newfound fondness for flashing flesh. That repetition isn't necessarily a problem, since she does formula very well, managing to appeal to both housewives as well as b-boys. Rainbow proves that she can still pull off that difficult balancing act, but it's hard not to be a little disappointed that she'd didn't shake the music up a little bit more -- after all, it would have been a more effective album if the heartbreak, sorrow, and joy that bubbles underneath the music were brought to the surface.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	7	CD	2026-01-18 22:01:14.801333	2
347618	E=MC² (MC30 Edition)	Mariah Carey	78.51	https://static.qobuz.com/images/covers/yb/lw/poyzm0mknlwyb_600.jpg	qobuz:114088134|poyzm0mknlwyb	Two weeks prior to the April 2008 release of E=MC2 -- Mariah Carey's tenth album and the sequel to her big 2005 comeback, The Emancipation of Mimi -- the diva broke Elvis Presley's record of being the solo artist with the most number one singles on the Billboard charts. Lots of publicity surrounded "Touch My Body" reaching number one, as well it should: busting an Elvis record is always news, but this particular record served team Mariah well, as it paints Carey as being a diva who's bigger and better than the rest. An unintentional side effect of this very record is that it also tacitly pointed out that Mariah has been around a long, long time: 18 years, to be exact, roughly two years shy of the two decades that it took Elvis to establish his record. Unlike Elvis -- or any other major artist who's been around for two decades, for that matter -- Carey seems determined not to look back, to exist in some kind of eternal now, never acknowledging that she has a past, unless she's wielding her divorce from her ex-husband/ex-record label chief Tommy Mottola for some kind of sympathy, something she does once again here via vague allusions to naïveté and "violent times" on "Side Effects." Mariah refers to that separation so often that it's hard not to think of it as something recent but it happened a long, long time ago -- well over a decade prior to the release of E=MC2, to be precise -- but as the separation was the pivot point for Carey's career, it's easy to see why she keeps returning to it, even if the emotional heft of her singing about the pain has long since diminished. After that separation, Carey restyled herself as a relentlessly modern R&B diva, chasing every passing trend in a given year, a move that often kept her on the top of the charts -- apart from the post-millennial stumble of Glitter, of course -- but had the side effect of making Mariah a musician who became progressively less mature with each passing year, culminating in the hazy soft-porn fantasies of "Touch My Body," the single that broke Elvis' longstanding record and will likely only be remembered for that achievement. Like so much of Emancipation and E=MC2, which is a virtual replica of its predecessor in almost every way, "Touch My Body" is all about sound, rhythm, and texture and not so much about song, something that helps sustain Mariah Carey's run at the top the charts, but something that also pushes melodic hooks, and in the process singing, into the background. As Carey's multi-octave voice has always been her calling card, the one thing that even her biggest critics have grudgingly acknowledged as her unassailable strength, this is a little odd -- especially on the T-Pain duet "Migrate," where she succumbs to auto-tune -- but it not only makes Mariah modern, it also camouflages her slightly diminishing range, so it does have a dual purpose. Sometimes all this production is good and occasionally it's married to a full-fledged, hooky song, as on the excellent "I'm That Chick," a sleek slice of Off the Wall disco that's nearly giddy in its energy and melody, and perhaps on "I'll Be Lovin' U Long Time," which also has a lightness that so much of E=MC2 lacks. Everything else pushes the rhythm and bass to the forefront and mixes Mariah into the middle, so it becomes a wash of sound -- sound that is designed to be fashionable, but like so much fashion, it's tied to the time and dates quickly. Which is why it's misleading to judge Mariah based on her new record of possessing the most number one singles, as she's not about longevity, she's about being permanently transient, a characteristic E=MC2 captures all too well.© Stephen Thomas Erlewine /TiVo	32	CD	2026-01-18 22:01:14.801333	2

Arriving on the heels of a two-year hiatus, the record is the singer's first not to feature her empath "Cry Baby" persona, the focus of both 2015's Cry Baby and 2019's K-12. Thematically, PORTALS is an album about death and rebirth with songs that speak to Martinez's ongoing knack for reinventing her sci-fantasy baby girl aesthetic in ever more musically nuanced and diaristic ways. Produced with collaborator C.J. Baran, PORTALS sounds similar to her past work, a textural blend of electronic grooves and instrumentation that she smartly blends with more organic strings, woody bass, and sundry other analog instruments. Vocally, Martinez also still has her distinctively cherubic style, like an anime alien who listened to a lot of Feist and Rihanna. That said, there's a growing maturity to her work and never a sense that she's not in complete control of what she's creating. This is perhaps best expressed on the opening "DEATH," a moody, orchestral-tinged anthem that feels like it's about reclaiming one's emotions after a difficult breakup. While some of PORTALS can sometimes lean heavily into midtempo, minor-key electronica, there are moments of thrilling alt-rock anthemics, including the Garbage-esque "BATTLE OF THE LARYNX" with its chugging guitar riff and tidal wave synths. There's also "VOID," which sounds something like Billie Eilish crossed with the Cure. Equally compelling is "MOON CYCLE," in which Martinez takes a strong, witchy feminist stance, singing, "I could win a fight on my period/Matter of fact, right now, I could build a pyramid/You messing with my cycle, that is dangerous."© Matt Collar /TiVo	22	Vinyl	2026-01-18 21:50:56.762616	1

It is less so to be popular, commercial AND brilliant. Yelich-O’Connor, aka Lorde, runs straight into this category reserved to a fortunate few. With Melodrama, the young New Zealander confirms a talent that was already impressive on Pure Heroine, her first album from 2013 released when she was only 16! All the elements of the pop identity are there. Lorde talks about herself, about being a 20 year old woman from the suburbs, about her dreams, solitude and ennui, about the transition to adulthood, about love of course, and also about disillusionment. In short, no pop cliché is missing. Lorde works wonders with the raw material accessible to all. Without trying to make the genre appear more complex, and staying firmly rooted in it, she establishes her singularity, her style, her name. “Writing Pure Heroine was my way of enshrining our teenage glory, putting it up in lights forever so that part of me never dies. Well, Melodrama is about what comes next... The party is about to start. I am about to show you the new world.” With this second album, she highlights even more the quality of her writing, and of her voice too. Musically, there is no lurid effect because everything is done to magnify the song, and nothing but the song. In a way, the mastery radiating from Melodrama puts her closer to Madonna, Elton John or Kate Bush than to Katy Perry or Miley Cyrus. And in her post teenager coating, she almost offers the ingenuousness of a rather mature soul singer… In short, such an understanding of the pop dialect at only 20 is rather astounding… © CM/Qobuz	27	CD	2026-01-18 21:58:41.699373	2

Albumul are o energie puternică, provocatoare și teatrală, folosind metafora circului pentru a vorbi despre faima intensă, presiunea publică și controlul asupra propriei imagini.\r\n\r\nDin punct de vedere muzical, Circus combină pop-ul comercial cu influențe de electropop, dance și synth-pop, având o producție modernă, agresivă pe alocuri, dar foarte catchy. Piesele alternează între atitudinea sigură pe sine și momente mai vulnerabile, reflectând dualitatea artistei: superstarul aflat sub reflectoare și femeia care încearcă să-și recapete echilibrul.\r\n\r\nTextele vorbesc despre putere, seducție, libertate și expunere, iar imaginea albumului o prezintă pe Britney ca pe o „ringmaster” – cea care preia din nou controlul spectacolului. Circus transmite ideea că, deși viața ei a fost privită ca un spectacol public, artista este cea care decide regulile jocului.\r\n\r\nPer total, albumul este perceput ca un comeback solid, cu un sound încrezător și o identitate vizuală puternică, consolidând statutul lui Britney Spears ca figură centrală a pop-ului modern	15	Vinyl	2026-01-18 23:00:25.10546	1
